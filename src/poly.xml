  <title>Polynomials</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Most people are fairly familiar with polynomials by the time they begin to study abstract algebra.
      When we examine polynomial expressions such as
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = x^3 -3x +2</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = 3x^2 -6x +5</mrow>
      </md>,
      we have a pretty good idea of what
      <m>p(x) + q(x)</m> and <m>p(x) q(x)</m> mean.
      We just add and multiply polynomials as functions; that is,
      <md>
        <mrow>(p +q)(x) &amp; = p(x) + q(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; =  ( x^3 - 3 x + 2 ) + ( 3 x^2 - 6 x + 5 )</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = x^3 + 3 x^2 - 9 x + 7</mrow>
      </md>
      and
      <md>
        <mrow>(p q)(x) &amp; = p(x)  q(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; =  ( x^3 - 3 x + 2 )  ( 3 x^2 - 6 x + 5 )</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = 3 x^5 - 6 x^4 - 4 x^3 + 24 x^2 - 27 x + 10</mrow>
      </md>.
      It is probably no surprise that polynomials form a ring.
      In this chapter we shall emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials by studying polynomial rings.
      We can prove many results for polynomial rings that are similar to the theorems we proved for the integers.
      Analogs of prime numbers,
      the division algorithm, and the Euclidean algorithm exist for polynomials.

    <title>Polynomial Rings</title>
    <p>
      Throughout this chapter we shall assume that <m>R</m> is a commutative ring with identity.
      Any expression of the form
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum^{n}_{i=0} a_i x^i = a_0 + a_1 x +a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n

      where <m>a_i \in R</m> and <m>a_n \neq 0</m>,
      is called a <term>polynomial over <m>R</m></term><idx><h>Polynomial</h><h>definition of</h></idx> with

      <m>x</m>.
      The elements <m>a_0, a_1, \ldots,
      a_n</m> are called the <term>coefficients</term> of <m>f</m>.
      The coefficient <m>a_n</m> is called the
      <idx><h>Polynomial</h><h>leading coefficient of</h></idx><term>leading coefficient</term>. 
      A polynomial is called <term>monic</term><idx><h>Polynomial</h><h>monic</h></idx><idx><h>Monic polynomial</h></idx>
      if the leading coefficient is 1.
      If <m>n</m> is the largest nonnegative number for which <m>a_n \neq 0</m>,
      we say that the <term>degree</term><idx><h>Polynomial</h><h>degree of</h></idx> of <m>f</m> is <m>n</m> and write <m>\deg f(x) = n</m>.

      <notation>

        <description>degree of a polynomial</description>
      </notation>

      If no such <m>n</m> exists<mdash/>that is,
      if <m>f=0</m> is the zero polynomial<mdash/>then the degree of <m>f</m> is defined to be <m>-\infty</m>.
      We will denote the set of all polynomials with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> by <m>R[x]</m>.

      <notation>
        <usage><m>R[x]</m></usage>
        <description>ring of polynomials over a ring <m>R</m></description>
      </notation>

      Two polynomials are equal exactly when their corresponding coefficients are equal; that is,
      if we let
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m</mrow>
      </md>,
      then <m>p(x) = q(x)</m> if and only if
      <m>a_i = b_i</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To show that the set of all polynomials forms a ring,
      we must first define addition and multiplication.
      We define the sum of two polynomials as follows.
      Let
      <md>
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m</mrow>
      </md>.
      Then the sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is
      <me>
        p(x) + q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_k x^k
      </me>,
      where <m>c_i = a_i + b_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
      We define the product of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> to be
      <me>
        p(x) q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_{m + n} x^{m + n}
      </me>,
      where
      <me>
        c_i = \sum_{k = 0}^i a_k b_{i - k} = a_0  b_i + a_1 b_{i -1} + \cdots + a_{i -1} b _1 + a_i b_0
      </me>
      for each <m>i</m>.
      Notice that in each case some of the coefficients may be zero.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="poly-example-operations">
      <p>
        Suppose that
        <me>
          p(x) = 3 + 0 x + 0 x^2 + 2 x^3 + 0 x^4
        </me>
        and
        <me>
          q(x) = 2 + 0 x - x^2 + 0 x^3 + 4 x^4
        </me>
        are polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>.
        If the coefficient of some term in a polynomial is zero,
        then we usually just omit that term.
        In this case we  would write
        <m>p(x) =  3 + 2 x^3</m> and <m>q(x) = 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4</m>.
        The sum of these two polynomials is
        <me>
          p(x) + q(x)= 5 - x^2 + 2 x^3 + 4 x^4
        </me>.
        The product,
        <me>
          p(x) q(x) = (3 + 2 x^3)( 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4 ) =  6 - 3x^2 + 4 x^3 + 12 x^4  - 2 x^5 + 8 x^7
        </me>,
        can be calculated either by determining the <m>c_i</m>s in the definition or by simply multiplying polynomials in the same way as we have always done.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="poly-example-integral-domains">
      <p>
        Let
        <me>
          p(x) = 3 + 3 x^3 \qquad \text{and} \qquad q(x) = 4 + 4 x^2 + 4 x^4
        </me>
        be polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}[x]</m>.
        The sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is <m>7 + 4 x^2 + 3 x^3 + 4 x^4</m>.
        The product of the two polynomials is  the zero polynomial.
        This example tells us that we can not expect <m>R[x]</m> to be an integral domain if <m>R</m> is not an integral domain.

    <theorem xml:id="poly-theorem-1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity.
          Then <m>R[x]</m> is a commutative ring with identity.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Our first task is to show that <m>R[x]</m> is an abelian group under polynomial addition.
          The zero polynomial, <m>f(x) = 0</m>, is the additive identity.
          Given a polynomial <m>p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>,
          the inverse of <m>p(x)</m> is easily verified to be <m>-p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} (-a_i) x^i = -\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>.
          Commutativity and associativity follow immediately from the definition of polynomial addition and from the fact that addition in <m>R</m> is both commutative and associative.
        </p>

        <p>
          To show that polynomial multiplication is associative, let

            <mrow>r(x) &amp; = \sum_{i = 0}^{p} c_i x^i</mrow>
          </md>.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>[p(x) q(x)] r(x) &amp; = \left[ \left( \sum_{i=0}^{m} a_i x^i  \right) \left(  \sum_{i=0}^{n} b_i x^i \right) \right] \left( \sum_{i = 0}^{p} c_i x^i \right)</mrow>

            <mrow>&amp; = \sum_{i = 0}^{m + n + p} \left[ \sum_{j = 0}^{i} \left( \sum_{k=0}^j a_k b_{j-k} \right) c_{i-j} \right] x^i</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = \sum_{i = 0}^{m + n + p} \left(\sum_{j + k + l = i} a_j b_k c_l \right) x^i</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = \sum_{i = 0}^{m+n+p} \left[ \sum_{j = 0}^{i} a_j  \left( \sum_{k = 0}^{i - j} b_k c_{i - j - k} \right) \right]  x^i</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = \left( \sum_{i = 0}^{m} a_i x^i  \right) \left[ \sum_{i = 0}^{n + p}  \left( \sum_{j = 0}^{i} b_j c_{i - j} \right) x^i \right]</mrow>

            <mrow>&amp; = p(x) [ q(x) r(x) ]</mrow>

          The commutativity and distribution properties of polynomial multiplication are proved in a similar manner.
          We shall leave the proofs of these properties as an exercise.

          Let <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> be polynomials in <m>R[x]</m>,
          where <m>R</m> is an integral domain.
          Then <m>\deg p(x) + \deg q(x) = \deg( p(x) q(x) )</m>.

          Suppose that we have two nonzero polynomials

          The leading term of <m>p(x) q(x)</m> is <m>a_m b_n x^{m + n}</m>,
          which cannot be zero since <m>R</m> is an integral domain;

          and <m>p(x)q(x) \neq 0</m>.
          Since <m>p(x) \neq 0</m> and

      We also want to consider polynomials in two or more variables,

      Let <m>R</m> be a ring and suppose that we are given two indeterminates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      Certainly we can form the ring <m>(R[x])[y]</m>.
      It is straightforward but perhaps tedious to show that <m>(R[x])[y] \cong R([y])[x]</m>.
      We shall identify these two rings by this isomorphism and simply write <m>R[x,y]</m>.
      The ring <m>R[x, y]</m> is called the

      Recall that the division algorithm for integers (<xref ref="integers-theorem-division_algorithm"/>) says that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers with <m>b \gt 0</m>,
      then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>a = bq + r</m>,

      The algorithm by which <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> are found is just long division.
      A similar theorem exists for polynomials.
      The division algorithm for polynomials has several important consequences.
      Since its proof is very similar to the corresponding proof for integers,
      it is worthwhile to review <xref ref="integers-theorem-division_algorithm"/> at this point.

        <p>
          Suppose that <m>\alpha \in F</m> and <m>p( \alpha ) = 0</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          We will use induction on the degree of <m>p(x)</m>.
          If <m>\deg p(x) = 0</m>,
          then <m>p(x)</m> is a constant polynomial and has no zeros.
          Let <m>\deg p(x) = 1</m>.

        <p>
          Now assume that <m>\deg p(x) \gt 1</m>.
          If <m>p(x)</m> does not have a zero in <m>F</m>, then we are done.
          On the other hand, if <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>p(x)</m>,

          The degree of <m>q(x)</m> is <m>n-1</m> by <xref ref="poly-proposition-integral-domain"/>.
          Let <m>\beta</m> be some other zero of <m>p(x)</m> that is distinct from <m>\alpha</m>.
          Then <m>p(\beta) = (\beta - \alpha) q(\beta) = 0</m>.
          Since <m>\alpha \neq \beta</m> and <m>F</m> is a field,
          <m>q(\beta ) = 0</m>.
          By our induction hypothesis,

        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> be a field and suppose that <m>d(x)</m> is a greatest common divisor of two polynomials <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
          Then there exist polynomials <m>r(x)</m> and <m>s(x)</m> such that

          Furthermore,
          the greatest common divisor of two polynomials is unique.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>d(x)</m> be the monic polynomial of smallest degree in the set
          <me>
            S = \{ f(x) p(x) + g(x) q(x) : f(x), g(x) \in F[x]  \}
          </me>.
          We can write <m>d(x) = r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x)</m> for two polynomials  <m>r(x)</m> and <m>s(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
          We need to show that <m>d(x)</m> divides both <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
          We shall first show that <m>d(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>.
          By the division algorithm,
          there exist polynomials <m>a(x)</m> and <m>b(x)</m> such that <m>p(x) = a(x) d(x) + b(x)</m>,
          where <m>b(x)</m> is either the zero polynomial or <m>\deg b(x) \lt \deg d(x)</m>.
          Therefore,

          </md>
          is a linear combination of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> and therefore must be in <m>S</m>.
          However, <m>b(x)</m> must be the zero polynomial since <m>d(x)</m> was chosen to be of smallest degree;
          consequently, <m>d(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>.
          A symmetric argument shows that <m>d(x)</m> must also divide <m>q(x)</m>;
          hence, <m>d(x)</m> is a common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To show that <m>d(x)</m> is a greatest common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>,
          suppose that <m>d'(x)</m> is another common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
          We will show that <m>d'(x) \mid d(x)</m>.
          Since <m>d'(x)</m> is a common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>,
          there exist polynomials <m>u(x)</m> and <m>v(x)</m> such that
          <m>p(x) = u(x) d'(x)</m> and <m>q(x) = v(x) d'(x)</m>.
          Therefore,
          <md>
            <mrow>d(x) &amp; = r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x)</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; =  r(x) u(x) d'(x) + s(x) v(x) d'(x)</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = d'(x) [r(x) u(x) + s(x) v(x)]</mrow>
          </md>.
          Since <m>d'(x) \mid d(x)</m>,
          <m>d(x)</m> is a greatest common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.

        <p>
          Finally, we must show that the greatest common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is unique.
          Suppose that <m>d'(x)</m> is another greatest common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
          We have just shown that there exist polynomials <m>u(x)</m> and <m>v(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m> such that <m>d(x) = d'(x)[r(x) u(x) + s(x) v(x)]</m>.
          Since
          <me>
            \deg d(x) =  \deg d'(x) + \deg[r(x) u(x) + s(x) v(x)]
          </me>
          and <m>d(x)</m> and <m>d'(x)</m> are both greatest common divisors,
          <m>\deg d(x) = \deg d'(x)</m>.
          Since <m>d(x)</m> and <m>d'(x)</m> are both monic polynomials of the same degree,
          it must be the case that <m>d(x) = d'(x)</m>.

          <p>
            If <m>d = 1</m>,
            then <m>c a_m b_n = 1</m> since <m>p(x)</m> is a monic polynomial.
            Hence, either <m>c=1</m> or <m>c = -1</m>.
            If <m>c = 1</m>, then either
            <m>a_m = b_n = 1</m> or <m>a_m = b_n = -1</m>.

            In the second case <m>a(x) = -\alpha_1(x)</m> and

            The case in which <m>c = -1</m> can be handled similarly.

          <p>

            Also, since the coefficients of

            Since <m>p \mid d</m>,
            <m>\alpha_1'(x) \beta_1'(x) = 0</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_p[x]</m>.
            However, this is impossible since neither <m>\alpha_1'(x)</m> nor

            By Gauss's Lemma (see <xref ref="poly-theorem-eisenstein"/> and <xref ref="domains-lemma-ufd-factorization"/>),

            Let <m>I</m> be an ideal of <m>F[x]</m>.
            If <m>I</m> is the zero ideal,

            Since 1 generates all of <m>F[x]</m>,
            <m>\langle 1 \rangle = I = F[x]</m> and <m>I</m> is again a principal ideal.

          It is not the case that every ideal in the ring <m>F[x,y]</m> is a principal ideal.
          Consider the ideal of <m>F[x, y]</m> generated by the polynomials <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          This is the ideal of <m>F[x, y]</m> consisting of all polynomials with no constant term.
          Since both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are in the ideal,
          no single polynomial can generate the entire ideal.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field and suppose that <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>.
            Then the ideal generated by <m>p(x)</m> is maximal if and only if <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>p(x)</m> generates a maximal ideal of <m>F[x]</m>.
            Then <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is also a prime ideal of <m>F[x]</m>.
            Since a maximal ideal must be properly contained inside <m>F[x]</m>,
            <m>p(x)</m> cannot be a constant polynomial.
            Let us assume that <m>p(x)</m> factors into two polynomials of lesser degree,
            say <m>p(x) = f(x) g(x)</m>.
            Since <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a prime ideal one of these factors,
            say <m>f(x)</m>,
            is in <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> and therefore be a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>.
            But this would imply that <m>\langle p(x) \rangle \subset \langle f(x) \rangle</m>,
            which is impossible since <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is maximal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conversely, suppose that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>F[x]</m>.
            Let <m>I</m> be an ideal in <m>F[x]</m> containing <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
            By <xref ref="poly-theorem-principal-ideal"/>, <m>I</m> is a principal ideal;
            hence, <m>I = \langle f(x) \rangle</m> for some <m>f(x) \in F[x]</m>.
            Since <m>p(x) \in I</m>,
            it must be the case that <m>p(x) = f(x) g(x)</m> for some <m>g(x) \in F[x]</m>.
            However, <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible;
            hence, either <m>f(x)</m> or <m>g(x)</m> is a constant polynomial.
            If <m>f(x)</m> is constant, then <m>I = F[x]</m> and we are done.
            If <m>g(x)</m> is constant,
            then <m>f(x)</m> is a constant multiple of <m>I</m> and <m>I = \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
            Thus, there are no proper ideals of <m>F[x]</m> that properly contain <m>\langle p(x)\rangle</m>.

          Polynomial rings are very important for computational approaches to algebra,
          and so Sage makes it very easy to compute with polynomials,
          over rings, or over fields.
          And it is trivial to check if a polynomial is irreducible.

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p>
        Throughout history,
        the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem.
        The Babylonians knew how to solve the equation <m>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</m>.
        Omar Khayyam (1048<ndash/>1131) devised methods of solving cubic equations through the use of geometric constructions and conic sections.
        The algebraic solution of the general cubic equation
        <m>ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0</m> was not discovered until the sixteenth century.
        An Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli (ca. 1445<ndash/>1509),
        wrote in <pubtitle>Summa de Arithmetica</pubtitle> that the solution of the cubic was impossible.
        This was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community.
      </p>
            <!-- % 2010/11/1 T Judson Spelling corrected Luca Pacioli (Thanks to Roberto Derenzi) -->
      <p>
        Scipione del Ferro<idx><h>Ferro, Scipione del</h></idx>
        (1465<ndash/>1526), of the University of Bologna,
        solved the <q>depressed cubic,</q>
        <me>
          ax^3 + cx + d = 0
        </me>.
        He kept his solution an absolute secret.
        This may seem surprising today,
        when mathematicians are usually very eager to publish their results,
        but in the days of the Italian Renaissance secrecy was customary.
        Academic appointments were not easy to secure and depended on the ability to prevail in public contests.
        Such challenges could be issued at any time.
        Consequently,
        any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest.
        If an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved,
        del Ferro could in turn present a list of depressed cubics.
        He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life,
        passing it on only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior<idx><h>Fior, Antonio</h></idx>
        (ca. 1506<ndash/>?).
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Fior was not the equal of his teacher,
        he immediately issued a challenge to Niccolo Fontana (1499<ndash/>1557).
        Fontana was known as Tartaglia<idx><h>Tartaglia</h></idx>
        (the Stammerer).
        As a youth he had suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village.
        He survived the savage wound,
        but his speech was permanently impaired.
        Tartaglia sent Fior a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of 30 depressed cubics.
        Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail.
        After much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated Fior,
        who faded into obscurity.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano<idx><h>Cardano, Gerolamo</h></idx>
        (1501<ndash/>1576), entered the story.
        Cardano wrote to Tartaglia,
        begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic.
        Tartaglia refused several of his requests,
        then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else.
        Using the knowledge that he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic
        <me>
          a x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
        </me>.
        Cardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari<idx><h>Ferrari, Ludovico</h></idx>
        (1522<ndash/>1565), who solved the general quartic equation,
        <me>
          a x^4 + b x^3 + cx^2 + d x + e = 0
        </me>.
        In 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferro's papers and discovered that he had also solved the depressed cubic.
        Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia,
        so he proceeded to publish the solutions in <pubtitle>Ars Magna</pubtitle> (1545),
        in which he gave credit to del Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic.
        This resulted in a bitter dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia,
        who published the story of the oath a year later.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Sage is particularly adept at building,
        analyzing and manipulating polynomial rings.
        We have seen some of this in the previous chapter.
        Let's begin by creating three polynomial rings and checking some of their basic properties.
        There are several ways to construct polynomial rings,
        but the syntax used here is the most straightforward.
      </p>
    </introduction>

                <input>
        S.&lt;y&gt; = ZZ[]; S
        </input>
                <output>
        Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>

        </output>

      <p>
        Basic properties of rings are availble for these examples.

            </sage>

      <p>
        With the construction syntax used above,
        the variables can be used to create elements of the polynomial ring without explicit coercion
        (though we need to be careful about constant polynomials).

        Polynomials can be evaluated like they are functions,

      <p>
        Notice that <c>p</c> is a degree two polynomial,
        yet through a brute-force examination we see that the polynomial only has one root,
        contrary to our usual expectations.
        It can be even more unusual.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>

        Sage can create and manipulate rings of polynomials in more than one variable,
        though we will not have much occasion to use this functionality in this course.

      <title>Irreducible Polynomials</title>
      <p>
        Whether or not a polynomial factors,
        taking into consideration the ring used for its coefficients,
        is an important topic in this chapter and many of the following chapters.
        Sage can factor, and determine irreducibility,
        over the integers, the rationals, and finite fields.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, over the rationals.
      </p>

            <sage>

        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        q = 2*x^5 + 5/2*x^4 + 3/4*x^3 - 25/24*x^2 - x - 1/2
        q.is_irreducible()

                <output>
        False

            <sage>
                <input>

                <output>
        (2) * (x^2 + 3/2*x + 3/4) * (x^3 - 1/4*x^2 - 1/3)
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Factoring over the integers is really no different than factoring over the rationals.
        This is the content of <xref ref="poly-theorem-gauss-lemma"/> <mdash/> finding a factorization over the integers can be converted to finding a factorization over the rationals.
        So it is with Sage,
        there is little difference between working over the rationals and the integers.
        It is a little different working over a finite field.
        Commentary follows.

            <sage>
                <input>

            </sage>

      <p>
        To check these factorizations,
        we need to compute in the finite field, <c>F</c>,
        and so we need to know how the symbol <c>a</c> behaves.
        This symbol is considered as a root of a degree two polynomial over the integers mod 5, which we can get with the <c>.modulus()</c> method.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        F.modulus()
        </input>
                <output>
        x^2 + 4*x + 2
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        So <m>a^2+4a+2=0</m>, or <m>a^2=-4a-3=a+2</m>.
        So when checking the factorizations,
        anytime you see an <m>a^2</m> you can replace it by <m>a+2</m>.
        Notice that by <xref ref="poly-corollary-factor"/> we could find the one linear factor of <c>r</c>,
        and the four linear factors of <c>s</c>,
        through a brute-force search for roots.
        This is feasible because the field is finite.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        [t for t in F if r(t)==0]

            </sage>

      <p>
        However, <c>q</c> factors into a pair of degree 2 polynomials,
        so no amount of testing for roots will discover a factor.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Eisenstein's Criterion, we can create irreducible polynomials,
        such as in <xref ref="poly-example-eisenstein"/>.

      <p>
        Over the field <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m>,
        the field of integers mod a prime <m>p</m>, Conway polynomials are canonical choices of a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> that is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m>.
        See the exercises for more about these polynomials.

        If <m>F</m> is a field,
        then every ideal of <m>F[x]</m> is principal (<xref ref="poly-theorem-principal-ideal"/>).
        Nothing stops you from giving Sage two
        (or more)
        generators to construct an ideal,
        but Sage will determine the element to use in a description of the ideal as a principal ideal.

        s = 3*w^5 - 14*w^4 + 12*w^3 - 6*w^2 + w
        S = W.ideal(r, s)
        S
        </input>
                <output>

        Univariate Polynomial Ring in w over Rational Field

      <p>
        <xref ref="poly-theorem-max-ideal"/> is the key fact that allows us to easily construct finite fields.
        Here is a construction of a finite field of order <m>7^5=16\,807</m>.
        All we need is a polynomial of degree <m>5</m> that is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Z}_7</m>.

      <p>
        The symbol <c>xbar</c> is a generator of the field,
        but right now it is not accessible. <c>xbar</c> is the coset <m>x + \langle x^5+ x + 4\rangle</m>.
        A better construction would include specifying this generator.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the polynomial <m>x^3-3x+4</m>.
          Compute the most thorough factorization of this polynomial over each of the following fields: (a) the finite field
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_5</m>, (b) a finite field with 125 elements, (c) the rationals, (d) the real numbers and (e) the complex numbers.
          To do this, build the appropriate polynomial ring,
          and construct the polynomial as a member of this ring,
          and use the <c>.factor()</c> method.

      <statement>
        <p>
          <q>Conway polynomials</q> are irreducible polynomials over <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> that Sage
          (and other software)
          uses to build maximal ideals in polynomial rings,
          and thus quotient rings that are fields.
          Roughly speaking, they are <q>canonical</q>
          choices for each degree and each prime.
          The command <c>conway_polynomial(p, n)</c> will return a database entry that is an irreducible polynomial of degree <m>n</m> over <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Execute the command <c>conway_polynomial(5, 4)</c> to obtain an allegedly irreducible polynomial of degree 4 over <m>{\mathbb Z}_5</m>:
          <m>p = x^{4} + 4x^{2} + 4x + 2</m>.
          Construct the right polynomial ring (<ie/>,
          in the indeterminate <m>x</m>) and verify that <c>p</c> is really an element of your polynomial ring.
        </p>

        <p>
          First determine that p has no linear factors.
          The only possibility left is that <c>p</c> factors as two quadratic polynomials over <m>{\mathbb Z}_5</m>.
          Use a list comprehension with <em>three</em>
          <c>for</c> statements to create <em>every</em>
          possible quadratic polynomial over <m>{\mathbb Z}_5</m>.
          Now use this list to create every possible product of two quadratic polynomials and check to see if <c>p</c> is in this list.

          Define the polynomials <m>p = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 4</m> and
          <m>q = x^4 + 2x^2</m> as polynomials with coefficients from the integers.
          Compute <c>gcd(p, q)</c> and verify that the result divides both <c>p</c> and <c>q</c>(just form a fraction in Sage and see that it simplifies cleanly,
          or use the <c>.quo_rem()</c> method).

        <p>
          <xref ref="poly-proposition-gcd"/> says there are polynomials <m>r(x)</m> and <m>s(x)</m> such that the greatest common divisor equals <m>r(x)p(x)+s(x)q(x)</m>,
          <em>if the coefficients come from a field</em>.
          Since here we have two polynomials over the integers,
          investigate the results returned by Sage for the extended gcd,
          <c>xgcd(p, q)</c>.
          In particular,
          show that the first result of the returned triple is a multiple of the gcd.
          Then verify the <q>linear combination</q> property of the result.

        <p>
          For a polynomial ring over a field, every ideal is principal.
          Begin with the ring of polynomials over the rationals.
          Experiment with constructing ideals using two generators and then see that Sage converts the ideal to a principal ideal with a single generator. (You can get this generator with the ideal method <c>.gen()</c>.) Can you explain how this single generator is computed?
