<title>Polynomials</title>

<introduction>
<p>FIXME: Move content in here</p>
</introduction>
 
Most people are fairly familiar with polynomials by the time they begin to study abstract algebra.  When we examine polynomial expressions such as 
<md><mrow> 
p(x) &amp; = x^3 -3x +2</mrow><mrow>
q(x) &amp; = 3x^2 -6x +5,
</mrow></md>
we have a pretty good idea of what <m>p(x) + q(x)</m> and <m>p(x) q(x)</m> mean.  We just add and multiply polynomials as functions; that is, 
<md><mrow>
(p +q)(x) &amp; = p(x) + q(x)</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =  ( x^3 - 3 x + 2 ) + ( 3 x^2 - 6 x + 5 )</mrow><mrow>
&amp; = x^3 + 3 x^2 - 9 x + 7
</mrow></md>
and
<md><mrow>
(p q)(x) &amp; = p(x)  q(x)</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =  ( x^3 - 3 x + 2 )  ( 3 x^2 - 6 x + 5 )</mrow><mrow>
&amp; = 3 x^5 - 6 x^4 - 4 x^3 + 24 x^2 - 27 x + 10.
</mrow></md>
It is probably no surprise that polynomials form a ring.  In this chapter we shall emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials by studying polynomial rings.  We can prove many results for polynomial rings that are similar to the theorems we proved for the integers.  Analogs of prime numbers, of the division algorithm, and of the Euclidean algorithm exist for polynomials.

<title>Polynomial Rings</title>\label{poly_section_1}
 
Throughout this chapter we shall assume that <m>R</m> is a commutative ring with identity.  Any expression of the form 
<me>
f(x) = \sum^{n}_{i=0} a_i x^i = a_0 + a_1 x +a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n, 
</me>
where <m>a_i \in R</m> and <m>a_n \neq 0</m>, is called a <term>polynomial over <m>R</m></term><index><main>Polynomial</main><sub>definition of</sub></index> with <term>indeterminate</term><index><main>Indeterminate</main></index> <m>x</m>.  The elements <m>a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n</m> are called the <term>coefficients</term> of <m>f</m>.  The coefficient <m>a_n</m> is called the <term>leading coefficient</term><index><main>Polynomial</main><sub>leading coefficient of</sub></index>.  A polynomial is called <term>monic</term><index><main>Polynomial</main><sub>monic</sub></index><index><main>Monic polynomial</main></index> if the leading coefficient is 1.  If <m>n</m> is the largest nonnegative number for which <m>a_n \neq 0</m>, we say that the <term>degree</term><index><main>Polynomial</main><sub>degree of</sub></index> of <m>f</m> is <m>n</m> and write <m>\deg f(x) = n</m>\label{polydegree}.  If no such <m>n</m> exists<mdash />that is, if <m>f=0</m> is the zero polynomial<mdash />then the degree of <m>f</m> is defined to be <m>-\infty</m>.  We will denote the set of all polynomials with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> by <m>R[x]</m>\label{polynomialring}.  Two polynomials are equal exactly when their corresponding coefficients are equal; that is, if we let    
<md><mrow>
p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow><mrow>
q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m,
</mrow></md>
then <m>p(x) = q(x)</m> if and only if <m>a_i = b_i</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>.

To show that the set of all polynomials forms a ring, we must first define addition and multiplication.  We define the sum of two polynomials as follows.  Let
<md><mrow>
p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow><mrow>
q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m.
</mrow></md>
Then the sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is
<me>
p(x) + q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_k x^k,
</me>
where <m>c_i = a_i + b_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.  We define the product of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> to be 
<me>
p(x) q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_{m + n} x^{m + n},
</me>
where
<me>
c_i = \sum_{k = 0}^i a_k b_{i - k} = a_0  b_i + a_1 b_{i -1} + \cdots + a_{i -1} b _1 + a_i b_0
</me>
for each <m>i</m>.  Notice that in each case some of the coefficients may be zero. 

<example xml:id="poly_operations">
<p>
Suppose that
<me>
p(x) = 3 + 0 x + 0 x^2 + 2 x^3 + 0 x^4
</me>
and
<me>
q(x) = 2 + 0 x - x^2 + 0 x^3 + 4 x^4
</me>
are polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>.  If the coefficient of some term in a polynomial is zero, then we usually just omit that term.  In this case we  would write <m>p(x) =  3 + 2 x^3</m> and <m>q(x) = 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4</m>.  The sum of these two polynomials is
<me>
p(x) + q(x)= 5 - x^2 + 2 x^3 + 4 x^4.
</me>
The product,
<me>
p(x) q(x) = (3 + 2 x^3)( 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4 ) =  6 - 3x^2 + 4 x^3 + 12 x^4  - 2 x^5 + 8 x^7,
</me>
can be calculated either by determining the <m>c_i</m>'s in the definition or by simply multiplying polynomials in the same way as we have
always done.
</p>
</example>

<example xml:id="poly_domain">
<p>
Let
<me>
p(x) = 3 + 3 x^3
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
q(x) = 4 + 4 x^2 + 4 x^4
</me>
be polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}[x]</m>. The sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is <m>7 + 4 x^2 + 3 x^3 + 4 x^4</m>.  The product of the two polynomials is  the zero polynomial.  This example tells us that <m>R[x]</m> cannot be an integral domain if <m>R</m> is not an integral domain.

FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>

<proof><p>
Our first task is to show that <m>R[x]</m> is an abelian group under polynomial addition.  The zero polynomial, <m>f(x) = 0</m>, is the additive identity.  Given a polynomial <m>p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>, the inverse of <m>p(x)</m> is easily verified to be <m>-p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} (-a_i) x^i = -\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>.  Commutativity and associativity follow immediately from the definition of polynomial addition and from the fact that addition in <m>R</m> is both commutative and associative.

To show that polynomial multiplication is associative, let

The commutativity and distribution properties of polynomial multiplication are proved in a similar manner.  We shall leave the proofs of these properties as an exercise.

<proposition xml:id="poly:integral_domain_ther">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> be polynomials in <m>R[x]</m>, where <m>R</m> is an integral domain.  Then <m>\deg p(x) + \deg q(x) = \deg( p(x) q(x) )</m>.  Furthermore, <m>R[x]</m> is an integral domain.

Suppose that we have two nonzero polynomials 
<me>
p(x) = a_m x^m + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0

and 
<me>
q(x) = b_n x^n + \cdots + b_1 x + b_0

The leading term of <m>p(x) q(x)</m> is <m>a_m b_n x^{m + n}</m>, which cannot be zero since <m>R</m> is an integral domain; hence, the degree of <m>p(x) q(x)</m> is <m>m + n</m>, and <m>p(x)q(x) \neq 0</m>.  Since <m>p(x) \neq 0</m> and <m>q(x) \neq 0</m> imply that <m>p(x)q(x) \neq 0</m>, we know that <m>R[x]</m> must also be an integral domain.

We also want to consider polynomials in two or more variables, such as <m>x^2 - 3 x y + 2 y^3</m>.  Let <m>R</m> be a ring and suppose that we are given two indeterminates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.  Certainly we can form the ring <m>(R[x])[y]</m>.  It is straightforward but perhaps tedious to show that <m>(R[x])[y] \cong R([y])[x]</m>.  We shall identify these two rings by this isomorphism and simply write <m>R[x,y]</m>.  The ring <m>R[x, y]</m> is called the <term>ring of polynomials in two indeterminates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> with coefficients in</term> <m>R</m>.  We can define the <term>ring of polynomials in</term><index><main>Polynomial!in <m>n</m> indeterminates</main></index> <m>n</m> <term>indeterminates with coefficients in</term> <m>R</m> similarly.

<title>The Division Algorithm</title>

Recall that the division algorithm for integers (Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="integers:division_algorithm" />) says
that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers with <m>b \gt 0</m>, then there exist unique
integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>a = bq+r</m>, where <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m>. The
algorithm by which <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> are found is just long division.  A
similar theorem exists for polynomials.	The division algorithm for
polynomials has several important consequences. Since its proof is
very similar to the corresponding proof for integers, it is worthwhile
to review Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="integers:division_algorithm" /> at this point.  
 
 
<theorem>
<statement>
<p> 
\textbf{(Division Algorithm)}\index{Division algorithm!for

r(x) \in F[x]$ such that 
<me>
f(x) = g(x) q(x) + r(x),
</me>
where either  <m>\deg r(x) \lt \deg g(x)</m> or <m>r(x)</m> is the zero
polynomial. 
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>

<!-- Statement of the division algorithm and the proof corrected.  Suggested by  P. Diethelm. -->
<!-- TWJ 16/8/2013 -->
 
 
<proof><p>
We will first consider the existence of <m>q(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m>.  If <m>f(x)</m> is the zero polynomial, then 
<me>
0 = 0 \cdot g(x) + 0;
</me>
hence, both <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> must also be the zero polynomial.  Now suppose that <m>f(x)</m> is not the zero polynomial and that <m>\deg f(x) = n</m> and <m>\deg g(x) = m</m>.   If <m>m \gt n</m>, then we can let <m>q(x) = 0</m> and <m>r(x) = f(x)</m>.  Hence, we may assume that <m>m  \leq n</m> and proceed by induction on <m>n</m>.   If
<md><mrow>
f(x) &amp; = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0</mrow><mrow>
g(x) &amp; = b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \cdots + b_1 x + b_0
</mrow></md>
the polynomial
<me>
f'(x) = f(x) - \frac{a_n}{b_m} x^{n-m} g(x)
</me>
has degree less than <m>n</m> or is the zero polynomial.  By induction, there exist polynomials <m>q'(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m> such that 
<me>
f'(x) = q'(x) g(x) + r(x),
</me>
where <m>r(x) = 0</m> or the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>g(x)</m>.  Now let
<me>
q(x) = q'(x) + \frac{a_n}{b_m} x^{n-m}.
</me>
Then
<me>
f(x) = g(x) q(x) + r(x),
</me>
with <m>r(x)</m> the zero polynomial or <m>\deg r(x) \lt \deg g(x)</m>. 
 
To show that  <m>q(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m> are unique, suppose that there exist
two other polynomials <m>q_1(x)</m> and <m>r_1(x)</m> such that $f(x) = g(x) q_1(x)
+ r_1(x)<m> with </m>\deg r_1(x) \lt \deg g(x)<m> or </m>r_1(x) = 0$, so that
<me>
f(x) = g(x) q(x) + r(x) = g(x) q_1(x) + r_1(x),
</me>
and
<me>
g(x) [q(x) - q_1(x) ] = r_1(x) - r(x).
</me>
If <m>g(x)</m> is not the zero polynomial, then 
<me>
\deg( g(x) [q(x) - q_1(x) ] )= \deg( r_1(x) - r(x) ) \geq \deg g(x).
</me>
However, the degrees of both <m>r(x)</m> and <m>r_1(x)</m> are strictly less than
the degree of <m>g(x)</m>; therefore, <m>r(x) = r_1(x)</m> and <m>q(x) = q_1(x)</m>.

<example xml:id="poly_division">

The division algorithm merely formalizes long division of polynomials,
a task we have been familiar with since high school. For example,
suppose that we divide <m>x^3 - x^2 + 2 x - 3</m> by <m>x - 2</m>.

<p>
Let <m>F</m> be a field. A nonzero polynomial <m>p(x)</m> of degree <m>n</m> in

</corollary>
 
 
<proof><p>
We will use induction on the degree of <m>p(x)</m>. If <m>\deg p(x) = 0</m>,
then <m>p(x)</m> is a constant polynomial and has no zeros.  Let $\deg p(x)
= 1<m>. Then </m>p(x) = ax +b<m> for some </m>a<m> and </m>b<m> in </m>F<m>. If </m>\alpha_1$ and
<m>\alpha_2</m> are zeros of <m>p(x)</m>, then <m>a\alpha_1 + b = a\alpha_2 +b</m> or
<m>\alpha_1 = \alpha_2</m>. 
 
Now assume that <m>\deg p(x) \gt 1</m>. If <m>p(x)</m> does not have a zero in
<m>F</m>, then we are done.  On the other hand, if <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of
<m>p(x)</m>, then <m>p(x) = (x - \alpha ) q(x)</m> for some <m>q(x) \in F[x]</m> by
Corollary<nbsp /><xref ref="poly:factor_corollary" />. The degree of <m>q(x)</m> is <m>n-1</m> by Proposition<nbsp /><xref ref="poly:integral_domain_ther" />.
Let <m>\beta</m> be some other zero of <m>p(x)</m> that is distinct from
<m>\alpha</m>. Then <m>p(\beta) = (\beta - \alpha) q(\beta) = 0</m>. Since
<m>\alpha \neq \beta</m> and <m>F</m> is a field, <m>q(\beta ) = 0</m>. By our
induction hypothesis, <m>p(x)</m> can have at most <m>n -1</m> zeros in <m>F</m> that

<proof><p>
Let <m>d(x)</m> be the monic polynomial of smallest degree in the set 
<me>

 We can write
<m>d(x) = r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x)</m> for two polynomials  <m>r(x)</m> and <m>s(x)</m>
in <m>F[x]</m>. We need to show that <m>d(x)</m> divides both <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
We shall first show that <m>d(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>. By the division

<m>p(x) = a(x) d(x) + b(x)</m>, where <m>b(x)</m> is either the

is a linear combination of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> and therefore must be in
<m>S</m>. However, <m>b(x)</m> must be the zero polynomial since <m>d(x)</m> was
chosen to be of smallest degree; consequently, <m>d(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>. 
A symmetric argument shows that <m>d(x)</m> must also divide <m>q(x)</m>; hence,
<m>d(x)</m> is a common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>. 
 
 
To show that <m>d(x)</m> is a greatest common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>,
suppose that <m>d'(x)</m> is another common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
We will show that <m>d'(x) \mid d(x)</m>.  Since <m>d'(x)</m> is a common
divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>, there exist polynomials <m>u(x)</m> and
<m>v(x)</m> such that <m>p(x) = u(x) d'(x)</m> and <m>q(x) = v(x) d'(x)</m>.
Therefore,

Finally, we must show that the greatest common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and
<m>q(x)</m> is unique. Suppose that <m>d'(x)</m> is another greatest common
divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>. We have just shown that there exist
polynomials <m>u(x)</m> and <m>v(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m> such that $d(x) = d'(x)[r(x)
u(x) + s(x) v(x)]$. Since 
<me>
\deg d(x) =  \deg d'(x) + \deg[r(x) u(x) + s(x) v(x)]
</me>
and <m>d(x)</m> and <m>d'(x)</m> are both greatest common divisors, $\deg d(x) =

By Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="poly:integer_coef_lemma" />, we can assume that

\beta(x)  &amp; =  \frac{c_2}{d_2} (b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_n x^n)  =

where the <m>a_i</m>'s are relatively prime and the <m>b_i</m>'s are relatively
prime. Consequently, 
<me>
p(x) = \alpha(x) \beta(x) = \frac{c_1 c_2}{d_1 d_2} \alpha_1(x)
\beta_1(x) = \frac{c}{d} \alpha_1(x) \beta_1(x),
</me>
where  <m>c/d</m> is the product of <m>c_1/d_1</m> and <m>c_2/d_2</m> expressed in
lowest terms. Hence, <m>d p(x) = c \alpha_1(x) \beta_1(x)</m>. 

 
 
If <m>d = 1</m>, then <m>c a_m b_n = 1</m> since <m>p(x)</m> is a monic polynomial.
Hence, either <m>c=1</m> or <m>c = -1</m>. If <m>c=1</m>, then either <m>a_m = b_n = 1</m> or
<m>a_m = b_n = -1</m>. In the first case <m>p(x) = \alpha_1(x) \beta_1(x)</m>,
where <m>\alpha_1(x)</m> and <m>\beta_1(x)</m> are monic polynomials with $\deg
\alpha(x) = \deg \alpha_1(x)<m> and </m>\deg \beta(x) = \deg \beta_1(x)$.
In the second case <m>a(x) = -\alpha_1(x)</m> and <m>b(x) = -\beta_1(x)</m> are
the correct monic polynomials since $p(x) = (-\alpha_1(x))(-
\beta_1(x)) = a(x) b(x)<m>. The case in which </m>c = -1$ can be handled
similarly. 
 
 
Now suppose that <m>d \neq 1</m>. Since <m>\gcd(c, d) = 1</m>, there exists a
prime <m>p</m> such that <m>p \mid d</m> and <m>p \notdivide c</m>. Also, since the
coefficients of <m>\alpha_1(x)</m> are relatively prime, there exists a

a coefficient <m>b_j</m> of <m>\beta_1(x)</m> such that <m>p \notdivide b_j</m>. Let 
<m>\alpha_1'(x)</m> and <m>\beta_1'(x)</m> be the polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}_p[x]</m>
obtained by reducing the coefficients of <m>\alpha_1(x)</m> and

<m>\alpha_1'(x)</m> nor <m>\beta_1'(x)</m> is the zero polynomial and ${\mathbb

If <m>p(x)</m> has a linear factor in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>, then it has a zero in

Eisenstein's Criterion is more useful in constructing irreducible

any element <m>f(x)</m> in <m>I</m> as <m>p(x) q(x)</m> for some <m>q(x) \in F[x]</m>, it
must be the case that <m>I = \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.

It is not the case that every ideal in the ring <m>F[x,y]</m> is a

polynomials <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.  This is the ideal of <m>F[x, y]</m> consisting of
all polynomials with no constant term. Since both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are in

<statement>
<p>
Let <m>F</m> be a field and suppose that <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>. Then the ideal
generated by <m>p(x)</m> is maximal if and only if <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible.
</p>
FIXME-MOVE-IN-PROOF</statement>
</theorem>
 
 
<proof><p>
Suppose that <m>p(x)</m> generates a maximal ideal of <m>F[x]</m>. Then $\langle
p(x) \rangle<m> is also a prime ideal of </m>F[x]$. Since a maximal ideal
must be properly contained inside <m>F[x]</m>, <m>p(x)</m> cannot be a constant
polynomial. Let us assume that <m>p(x)</m> factors into two polynomials of
lesser degree, say <m>p(x) = f(x) g(x)</m>. Since <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is
a prime ideal one of these factors, say <m>f(x)</m>, is in $\langle p(x)
\rangle<m> and therefore be a multiple of </m>p(x)$. But this would imply
that <m>\langle p(x) \rangle \subset \langle f(x) \rangle</m>, which is 
impossible since <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is maximal.
 
 
Conversely, suppose that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>F[x]</m>. Let <m>I</m> be
an ideal in <m>F[x]</m> containing <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>. By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="poly:PI_theorem" />,
<m>I</m> is a principal ideal; hence, <m>I = \langle f(x) \rangle</m> for some
<m>f(x) \in F[x]</m>. Since <m>p(x) \in I</m>, it must be the case that $p(x) =
f(x) g(x)<m> for some </m>g(x) \in F[x]<m>. However, </m>p(x)$ is irreducible;
hence, either <m>f(x)</m> or <m>g(x)</m> is a constant polynomial. If <m>f(x)</m> is
constant, then <m>I = F[x]</m> and we are done.  If <m>g(x)</m> is constant, then
<m>f(x)</m> is a constant multiple of <m>I</m> and <m>I = \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
Thus, there are no proper ideals of <m>F[x]</m> that properly contain~
\mbox{<m>\langle p(x)\rangle</m>}.

<historical>
<p> <!-- % 2010/11/1 T Judson Spelling corrected Luca Pacioli (Thanks to Roberto Derenzi) -->
Throughout history, the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem.  The Babylonians knew how to solve the equation <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>.  Omar Khayyam (1048<ndash />1131) devised methods of solving cubic equations through the use of  geometric constructions and conic sections.  The algebraic solution of the general cubic equation <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</m> was not discovered until the sixteenth century.  An Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli (ca. 1445<ndash />1509), wrote  in <title>Summa de Arithmetica</title> that the solution of the cubic was impossible.  This was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community.

Scipione del Ferro<index><main>Ferro, Scipione del</main></index> (1465<ndash />1526), of the University of Bologna, solved the <q>depressed cubic,</q> 
<me>
ax^3 + cx + d = 0.
</me>
He kept his solution an absolute secret.  This may seem surprising today, when mathematicians are usually very eager to publish their results, but in the days of the Italian Renaissance secrecy was customary. Academic appointments were not easy to secure and depended on the ability to prevail in public contests.  Such challenges could be issued at any time.  Consequently, any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest. If an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved, del Ferro could in turn present a list of depressed cubics.  He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life, passing it on only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior<index><main>Fior, Antonio</main></index> (ca. 1506<ndash />?).  

Although Fior was not the equal of his teacher, he immediately issued a challenge to Niccolo Fontana (1499<ndash />1557).  Fontana was known as Tartaglia<index><main>Tartaglia</main></index> (the Stammerer).  As a youth he had suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village. He survived the savage wound, but his speech was permanently impaired.  Tartaglia sent Fior a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of 30 depressed cubics.  Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail.  After much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated Fior, who faded into obscurity. 

At this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano<index><main>Cardano, Gerolamo</main></index> (1501<ndash />1576), entered the story.  Cardano wrote to Tartaglia, begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic.  Tartaglia refused several of his requests, then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else. Using the knowledge that he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic 
<me>
a x^3 + bx^2 +cx +d = 0.
</me>
Cardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari<index><main>Ferrari, Ludovico</main></index> (1522<ndash />1565), who solved the general quartic equation, 
<me>
a x^4 + b x^3 + cx^2 + d x + e =0.
</me>
In 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferro's papers and discovered that he had also solved the depressed cubic.  Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia, so he proceeded to publish the solutions in <title>Ars Magna</title> (1545), in which he gave credit to del Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic.  This resulted in a bitter dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia, who published the story of the oath a year later.
