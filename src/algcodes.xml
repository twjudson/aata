  <title>Algebraic Coding Theory</title>
  <introduction permid="rMl">
    <p permid="cYZ">
      Coding theory is an application of algebra that has become increasingly important over the last several decades.
      When we transmit data,
      we are concerned about sending a message over a channel that could be affected by <q>noise.</q>
      We wish to be able to encode and decode the information in a manner that will allow the detection,
      and possibly the correction, of errors caused by noise.
      This situation arises in many areas of communications,
      including radio, telephone,
      television, computer communications,
      and digital media technology.
      Probability, combinatorics, group theory, linear algebra,
      and polynomial rings over finite fields all play important roles in coding theory.

        Uncoded messages may be composed of letters or characters,
        but typically they consist of binary <m>m</m>-tuples.
        These messages are encoded into codewords,
        consisting of binary <m>n</m>-tuples,
        by a device called an <term>encoder</term>.
        The message is transmitted and then decoded.
        We will consider the occurrence of errors during transmission.
        An <term>error</term> occurs if there is a change in one or more bits in the codeword.
        A <term>decoding scheme</term> is a method that either converts an arbitrarily received <m>n</m>-tuple into a meaningful decoded message or gives an error message for that <m>n</m>-tuple.
        If the received message is a codeword
        (one of the special <m>n</m>-tuples allowed to be transmitted),
        then the decoded message must be the unique message that was encoded into the codeword.
        For received non-codewords,
        the decoding scheme will give an error indication,
        or, if we are more clever,
        will actually try to correct the error and reconstruct the original message.
        Our goal is to transmit error-free messages as cheaply and quickly as possible.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="example-algcodes-repeat" permid="isz">
        <p permid="lIR">
          One possible coding scheme would be to send a message several times and to compare the received copies with one another.
          Suppose that the message to be encoded is a binary <m>n</m>-tuple <m>(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots,
          x_{n})</m>.
          The message is encoded into a binary <m>3n</m>-tuple by simply repeating the message three times:
          <me permid="pBM">
            (x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}) \mapsto (x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n})
          </me>.
          To decode the message,
          we choose as the <m>i</m>th digit the one that appears in the <m>i</m>th place in at least two of the three transmissions.
          For example, if the original message is <m>(0110)</m>,
          then the transmitted message will be <m>(0110\;  0110\;  0110)</m>.
          If there is a transmission error in the fifth digit,
          then the received codeword will be <m>(0110\;  1110\;  0110)</m>,
          which will be correctly decoded as <m>(0110)</m>.<fn>
          We will adopt the convention that bits are numbered left to right in binary <m>n</m>-tuples.
          </fn> This triple-repetition method will automatically detect and correct all single errors,
          but it is slow and inefficient:
          to send a message consisting of <m>n</m> bits,
          <m>2n</m> extra bits are required,
          and we can only detect and correct single errors.
          We will see that it is possible to find an encoding scheme that will encode a message of <m>n</m> bits into <m>m</m> bits with <m>m</m> much smaller than <m>3n</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-algcodes-even-parity" permid="OzI">
        <p permid="RQa">
          <term>Even parity</term>, a commonly used coding scheme,
          is much more efficient than the simple repetition scheme.
          The <acro>ASCII</acro> (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) coding system uses binary <m>8</m>-tuples,
          yielding <m>2^{8} = 256</m> possible <m>8</m>-tuples.
          However, only seven bits are needed since there are only
          <m>2^7 = 128</m> <acro>ASCII</acro> characters.
          What can or should be done with the extra bit?
          Using the full eight bits, we can detect single transmission errors.
          For example, the <acro>ASCII</acro> codes for A, B, and C are
          <md permid="VIV">
            <mrow>\text{A} &amp; = 65_{10} = 01000001_{2},</mrow>
            <mrow>\text{B} &amp; = 66_{10} = 01000010_{2},</mrow>
            <mrow>\text{C} &amp; = 67_{10} = 01000011_{2}</mrow>
          </md>.
          Notice that the leftmost bit is always set to 0;
          that is, the <m>128</m> <acro>ASCII</acro> characters have codes
          <md permid="BQe">
            <mrow>00000000_{2} &amp; = 0_{10},</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; \vdots</mrow>
            <mrow>01111111_{2} &amp; = 127_{10}</mrow>
          </md>.
          The bit can be used for error checking on the other seven bits.
          It is set to either <m>0</m> or <m>1</m> so that the total number of <m>1</m> bits in the representation of a character is even.
          Using even parity, the codes for A, B, and C now become
          <md permid="hXn">
            <mrow>\text{A} &amp; = 01000001_{2},</mrow>
            <mrow>\text{B} &amp; = 01000010_{2},</mrow>
            <mrow>\text{C} &amp; = 11000011_{2}</mrow>
          </md>.
          Suppose an A is sent and a transmission error in the sixth bit is caused by noise over the communication channel so that  <m>(0100\; 0101)</m> is received.
          We know an error has occurred since the received word has an odd number of <m>1</m>s,
          and we can now request that the codeword be transmitted again.
          When used for error checking,
          the leftmost bit is called a <term>parity check bit</term>.
        </p>

        <p permid="xXj">
          By far the most common error-detecting codes used in computers are based on the addition of a parity bit.
          Typically, a computer stores information in <m>m</m>-tuples called <term>words</term>.
          Common word lengths are <m>8</m>,
          <m>16</m>, and <m>32</m> bits.
          One bit in the word is set aside as the parity check bit,
          and is not used to store information.
          This bit is set to either <m>0</m> or <m>1</m>,
          depending on the number of <m>1</m>s in the word.
        </p>

        <p permid="ees">
          Adding a parity check bit allows the detection of all single errors because changing a single bit either increases or decreases the number of <m>1</m>s by one,
          and in either case the parity has been changed from even to odd,
          so the new word is not a codeword.
          (We could also construct an error detection scheme based on <term>odd parity</term>;
          that is, we could set the parity check bit so that a codeword always has an odd number of <m>1</m>s.)
        </p>
      </example>

      <p permid="VuA">
        The even parity system is easy to implement, but has two drawbacks.
        First, multiple errors are not detectable.
        Suppose an A is sent and the first and seventh bits are changed from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m>.
        The received word is a codeword,
        but will be decoded into a C instead of an A. Second,
        we do not have the ability to correct errors.
        If the 8-tuple <m>(1001\; 1000)</m> is received,
        we know that an error has occurred,
        but we have no idea which bit has been changed.
        We will now investigate a coding scheme that will not only allow us to detect transmission errors but will actually correct the errors.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="example-algcodes-nearest" permid="uGR">
        <p permid="KlB">
          Suppose that our original message is either a <m>0</m> or a <m>1</m>,
          and that <m>0</m> encodes to <m>(000)</m> and <m>1</m> encodes to <m>(111)</m>.
          If only a single error occurs during transmission,
          we can detect and correct the error.
          For example, if a <m>(101)</m> is received,
          then the second bit must have been changed from a <m>1</m> to a <m>0</m>.
          The originally transmitted codeword must have been <m>(111)</m>.
          This method will detect and correct all single errors.

      <p permid="fyg">
        The coding scheme presented in <xref ref="example-algcodes-nearest"/> is not a complete solution to the problem because it does not account for the possibility of multiple errors.
        For example,
        either a (000) or a (111) could be sent and a (001) received.
        We have no means of deciding from the received word whether there was a single error in the third bit or two errors,
        one in the first bit and one in the second.
        No matter what coding scheme is used,
        an incorrect message could be received.
        We could transmit a (000),
        have errors in all three bits,
        and receive the codeword (111).
        It is important to make explicit assumptions about the likelihood and distribution of transmission errors so that,
        in a particular application,
        it will be known whether a given error detection scheme is appropriate.
        We will assume that transmission errors are rare, and,
        that when they do occur, they occur independently in each bit;
        that is, if <m>p</m> is the probability of an error in one bit and <m>q</m> is the probability of an error in a different bit,
        then the probability of errors occurring in both of these bits at the same time is <m>pq</m>.
        We will also assume that a received <m>n</m>-tuple is decoded into a codeword that is closest to it;
        that is, we assume that the receiver uses
        <term>maximum-likelihood decoding</term>.

        If we are to develop efficient error-detecting and error-correcting codes,
        we will need more sophisticated mathematical tools.
        Group theory  will allow faster methods of encoding and decoding messages.
        A code is an <m>(n, m)</m>-<term>block code</term>
        if the information that is to be coded can be divided into blocks of <m>m</m> binary digits,
        each of which can be encoded into <m>n</m> binary digits.
        More specifically, an <m>(n, m)</m>-block code consists of an
        <term>encoding function</term>
        <me permid="LjQ">
          E:{\mathbb Z}^{m}_{2} \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}^{n}_{2}
        </me>
        and a <term>decoding function</term>
        <me permid="rqZ">
          D:{\mathbb Z}^{n}_{2} \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}^{m}_{2}
        </me>.
        A <term>codeword</term> is any element in the image of <m>E</m>.
        We also require that <m>E</m> be one-to-one so that two information blocks will not be encoded into the same codeword.
        If our code is to be error-correcting,
        then <m>D</m> must be onto.

        The weights in a particular code are usually much easier to compute than the Hamming distances between all codewords in the code.

        we can use this fact to our advantage.

        Suppose that <m>{\mathbf x} = (1101)</m> and
        <m>{\mathbf y} = (1100)</m> are codewords in some code.
        If we transmit <m>(1101)</m> and an error occurs in the rightmost bit,
        then (1100) will be received.
        Since <m>(1100)</m> is a codeword,
        the decoder will decode <m>(1100)</m> as the transmitted message.
        This code is clearly not very appropriate for error detection.
        The problem is that <m>d({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y}) = 1</m>.
        If <m>{\mathbf x} = (1100)</m> and <m>{\mathbf y} = (1010)</m> are codewords,
        then <m>d({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y}) = 2</m>.
        If <m>{\mathbf x}</m> is transmitted and a single error occurs,
        then <m>{\mathbf y}</m> can never be received.
        <xref ref="table-4-bit-words"/> gives the distances between all 4-bit codewords in which the first three bits carry information and the fourth is an even parity check bit.
        We can see that the minimum distance here is <m>2</m>;
        hence, the code is suitable as a single error-detecting code.

        To determine exactly what the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities for a code are,
        we need to analyze the minimum distance for the code.
        Let <m>{\mathbf x}</m> and <m>{\mathbf y}</m> be codewords.
        If <m>d({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y}) = 1</m> and an error occurs where
        <m>{\mathbf x}</m> and <m>{\mathbf y}</m> differ,
        then <m>{\mathbf x}</m> is changed to <m>{\mathbf y}</m>.
        The received codeword is <m>{\mathbf y}</m> and no error message is given.
        Now suppose <m>d({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y}) = 2</m>.
        Then a single error cannot change
        <m>{\mathbf x}</m> to <m>{\mathbf y}</m>.
        Therefore, if <m>d_{\min} = 2</m>,
        we have the ability to detect single errors.
        However, suppose that <m>d({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y}) = 2</m>,
        <m>{\mathbf y}</m> is sent,
        and a noncodeword <m>{\mathbf z}</m> is received such that
        <me permid="PTJ">
          d({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf z}) = d({\mathbf y}, {\mathbf z}) = 1
        </me>.
        Then the decoder cannot decide between
        <m>{\mathbf x}</m> and <m>{\mathbf y}</m>.
        Even though we are aware that an error has occurred,
        we do not know what the error is.

      <p permid="IKJ">
        Suppose <m>d_{\min} \geq 3</m>.
        Then the maximum-likelihood decoding scheme corrects all single errors.
        Starting with a codeword <m>{\mathbf x}</m>,
        an error in the transmission of a single bit gives
        <m>{\mathbf y}</m> with <m>d({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y}) = 1</m>,
        but <m>d({\mathbf z}, {\mathbf y}) \geq 2</m> for any other codeword <m>{\mathbf z} \neq {\mathbf x}</m>.
        If we do not require the correction of errors,
        then we can detect multiple errors when a code has a minimum distance that is greater than or equal to <m>3</m>.

        Modern coding theory began in 1948 with C. Shannon's
            <idx><h>Shannon, C.</h></idx>
        paper, <q>A Mathematical Theory of Information</q>
        [7]. This paper offered an example of an algebraic code,
        and Shannon's Theorem proclaimed exactly how good codes could be expected to be.
        Richard Hamming
            <idx><h>Hamming, R.</h></idx>
        began working with linear codes at Bell Labs in the late 1940s and early 1950s after becoming frustrated because the programs that he was running could not recover from simple errors generated by noise.
        Coding theory has grown tremendously in the past several decades.
        <em>The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes</em>,
        by MacWilliams and Sloane [5], published in 1977,
        already contained over 1500 references.
        Linear codes (Reed-Muller <m>(32, 6)</m>-block codes) were used on NASA's Mariner space probes.
        More recent space probes such as Voyager have used what are called convolution codes.
        Currently, very active research is being done with Goppa codes,
        which are heavily dependent on algebraic geometry.

    <title>Linear Codes</title>
    <introduction permid="EaD">
      <p permid="hIS">
        To gain more knowledge of a particular code and develop more efficient techniques of encoding,
        decoding,
        and error detection, we need to add additional structure to our codes.
        One way to accomplish this is to require that the code also be a group.
        A <term>group code</term>
            <idx><h>Code</h><h>group</h></idx>
        is a code that is also a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2^n</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="NQb">
        To check that a code is a group code,
        we need only verify one thing.
        If we add any two elements in the code,
        the result must be an <m>n</m>-tuple that is again in the code.
        It is not necessary to check that the inverse of the <m>n</m>-tuple is in the code,
        since every codeword is its own inverse,
        nor is it necessary to check that <m>{\mathbf 0}</m> is a codeword.
        For instance,
        <me permid="cib">
          (11000101) + (11000101) = (00000000)
        </me>.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="example-algcodes-weights" permid="aOa">
        <p permid="vcD">
          Suppose that we have a code that consists of the following 7-tuples:
          <md permid="Ipk">
            <mrow>&amp;(0000000) &amp; &amp; (0001111) &amp;  &amp; (0010101) &amp; &amp; (0011010)</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp;(0100110) &amp; &amp; (0101001) &amp; &amp; (0110011) &amp; &amp; (0111100)</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp;(1000011) &amp; &amp; (1001100) &amp; &amp; (1010110) &amp; &amp; (1011001)</mrow>

          </md>.
          It is a straightforward though tedious task to verify that this code is also a subgroup of
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2^7</m> and, therefore, a group code.
          This code is a single error-detecting and single error-correcting  code,
          but it is a long and tedious process to compute all of the distances between  pairs of codewords to determine that <m>d_{\min} = 3</m>.
          It is much easier to see that the minimum weight of all the nonzero codewords is <m>3</m>.
          As we will soon see, this is no coincidence.
          However, the relationship between weights and distances in a particular code is heavily dependent on the fact that the code is a group.
        </p>

            <m>{\mathbf x}</m> and <m>{\mathbf y}</m> differ.
            But <m>{\mathbf x}</m> and

            Consequently,

        From <xref ref="example-algcodes-weights"/>,
        it is now easy to check that the minimum nonzero weight is <m>3</m>;
        hence, the code does indeed detect and correct all single errors.
        We have now reduced the problem of finding <q>good</q>
        codes to that of generating group codes.
        One easy way to generate group codes is to employ a bit of matrix theory.

        Our task is to find out how knowing the cosets might help us to decode a message.
        Suppose that <m>{\mathbf x}</m> was the original codeword sent and that
        <m>{\mathbf r}</m> is the <m>n</m>-tuple received.
        If <m>{\mathbf e}</m> is the transmission error,
        then <m>{\mathbf r} = {\mathbf e} + {\mathbf x}</m> or,
        equivalently, <m>{\mathbf x} = {\mathbf e} + {\mathbf r}</m>.
        However, this is exactly the statement that
        <m>{\mathbf r}</m> is an element in the coset <m>{\mathbf e} + C</m>.
        In maximum-likelihood decoding we expect the error
        <m>{\mathbf e}</m> to be as small as possible;
        that is, <m>{\mathbf e}</m> will have the least weight.
        An <m>n</m>-tuple of least weight in a coset is called a
        <term>coset leader</term>.
            <idx><h>Coset</h><h>leader</h></idx>
        Once we have determined a coset leader for each coset,
        the decoding process becomes a task of calculating

          we find that it is in the coset <m>(00010) + C</m>;

        Given an <m>(n,k)</m>-block code,
        the question arises of whether or not coset decoding is a manageable scheme.
        A decoding table requires a list of cosets and syndromes,
        one for each of the <m>2^{n - k}</m> cosets of <m>C</m>.
        Suppose that we have a <m>(32, 24)</m>-block code.
        We have a huge number of codewords, <m>2^{24}</m>,
        yet there are only <m>2^{32 - 24} = 2^{8} = 256</m> cosets.

          A code with minimum distance <m>d</m> is called <term>perfect</term>

          If we expand our notion of geometry to account for the Hamming distance as the metric,

          the spheres of radius <m>d</m> centered at the codewords of the code will exactly partition the entire set of all possible vectors.
