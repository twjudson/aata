  <title>Fields</title>
  <introduction permid="GZN">
    <p permid="Kqf">
      It is natural to ask whether or not some field <m>F</m> is contained in a larger field.
      We think of the rational numbers,
      which reside inside the real numbers,
      while in turn, the real numbers live inside the complex numbers.
      We can also study the fields between <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and
      <m>{\mathbb R}</m> and inquire as to the nature of these fields.
    </p>

    <p permid="qxo">
      More specifically if we are given a field <m>F</m> and a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>,
      we can ask whether or not we can find a field <m>E</m> containing <m>F</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> factors into linear factors over <m>E[x]</m>.
      For example, if we consider the polynomial
      <me permid="pGq">
        p(x) = x^4 -5 x^2 + 6
      </me>
      in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>,
      then <m>p(x)</m> factors as <m>(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)</m>.
      However, both of these factors are irreducible in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>.
      If we wish to find a zero of <m>p(x)</m>,
      we must go to a larger field.
      Certainly the field of real numbers will work, since
      <me permid="VNz">
        p(x) = (x - \sqrt{2} ) (x + \sqrt{2} )( x - \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{3})
      </me>.
      It is possible to find a smaller field in which <m>p(x)</m> has a zero, namely
      <me permid="BUI">
        {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} ) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}
      </me>.
      We wish to be able to compute and study such fields for arbitrary polynomials over a field <m>F</m>.

        of a field <m>F</m> if <m>F</m> is a subfield of <m>E</m>.
        The field <m>F</m> is called the <term>base field</term>.
            <idx><h>Field</h><h>base</h></idx>
        We write <m>F \subset E</m>.

      <example xml:id="example-fields-q-sqrt2" permid="qbC">
        <p permid="oIb">
          For example, let
          <me permid="ibR">
            F = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{2}\,) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}

          and let <m>E =  {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,)</m> be the smallest field containing both
          <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m>.
          Both <m>E</m> and <m>F</m> are extension fields of the rational numbers.
          We claim that <m>E</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m>.
          To see this,
          we need only show that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is in <m>E</m>.
          Since <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is in <m>E</m>,
          <m>1 / (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,) = \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m> must also be in <m>E</m>.
          Taking linear combinations of
          <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m>,
          we find that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and
          <m>\sqrt{3}</m> must both be in <m>E</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-fields-finite-f4" permid="WiL">
        <p permid="UPk">
          Let <m>p(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>.
          Since neither 0 nor 1 is a root of this polynomial,
          we know that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
          We will construct a field extension of
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
          By <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>,
          the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is maximal;
          hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
          Let <m>f(x) + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> be an arbitrary element of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
          By the division algorithm,
          <me permid="Oja">
            f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1) q(x) + r(x)
          </me>,
          where the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>.
          Therefore,
          <me permid="uqj">
            f(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle = r(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle
          </me>.
          The only possibilities for <m>r(x)</m> are then <m>0</m>,
          <m>1</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>1 + x</m>.
          Consequently,
          <m>E = {\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with four elements and must be a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
          containing a zero <m>\alpha</m> of <m>p(x)</m>.
          The field <m>{\mathbb Z}_2(  \alpha)</m> consists of elements
          <md permid="GEB">
            <mrow>0 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 0</mrow>
            <mrow>1 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 1</mrow>
            <mrow>0 + 1 \alpha &amp; = \alpha</mrow>
            <mrow>1 + 1 \alpha &amp; = 1 + \alpha</mrow>
          </md>.
          Notice that <m>{\alpha}^2 + {\alpha} + 1 = 0</m>;
          hence, if we compute <m>(1 + \alpha)^2</m>,
          <me permid="axs">
            (1 + \alpha)(1 + \alpha)= 1 + \alpha + \alpha + (\alpha)^2 = \alpha
          </me>.
          Other calculations are accomplished in a similar manner.
          We summarize these computations in the following tables,
          which tell us how to add and multiply elements in <m>E</m>.

        The following theorem, due to Kronecker,
        is so important and so basic to our understanding of fields that it is often known as the Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory.

            <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof permid="fCx">
          <p permid="wHZ">
            To prove this theorem,
            we will employ the method that we used to construct <xref ref="example-fields-finite-f4"/>.
            Clearly, we can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is an irreducible polynomial.
            We wish to find an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
            The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is a maximal ideal in <m>F[x]</m> by <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>;
            hence, <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
            We claim that <m>E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is the desired field.
          </p>

          <p permid="cPi">
            We first show that <m>E</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.
            We can define a homomorphism of commutative rings by the map <m>\psi:F \rightarrow F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>,
            where <m>\psi(a) = a + \langle p(x)\rangle</m> for <m>a \in F</m>.
            It is easy to check that <m>\psi</m> is indeed a ring homomorphism.
            Observe that
            <me permid="zac">
              \psi( a ) + \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle) + (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = (a + b) + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a + b )
            </me>
            and
            <me permid="fhl">
              \psi( a ) \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle)  (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = ab + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( ab )
            </me>.
            To prove that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one, assume that
            <me permid="Lou">
              a + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi(a) = \psi(b) = b + \langle p(x) \rangle
            </me>.
            Then <m>a - b</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>,
            since it lives in the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
            Since <m>p(x)</m> is a nonconstant polynomial,
            the only possibility is that <m>a - b = 0</m>.
            Consequently, <m>a = b</m> and <m>\psi</m> is injective.
            Since <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one,
            we can identify <m>F</m> with the subfield
            <m>\{ a + \langle p(x) \rangle : a \in F \}</m> of <m>E</m> and view <m>E</m> as an extension field of <m>F</m>.
          </p>
            <!-- \alpha is in E not F - TWJ 4/23/2011 -->
          <p permid="IWr">
            It remains for us to prove that <m>p(x)</m> has a zero <m>\alpha \in E</m>.
            Set <m>\alpha = x + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
            Then <m>\alpha</m> is in <m>E</m>.
            If <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</m>, then
            <md permid="rvD">
              <mrow>p( \alpha ) &amp; =  a_0 + a_1( x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + a_n ( x + \langle p(x) \rangle)^n</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + ( a_1 x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + (a_n  x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle)</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = 0 + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
            </md>.
            Therefore, we have found an element
            <m>\alpha \in E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> such that <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>p(x)</m>.

      The question of uniqueness now arises for splitting fields.

      there exists a field isomorphism
      <m>\phi : K \rightarrow L</m> that preserves <m>F</m>.
      In order to prove this result,
      we must first prove a lemma.

          Then <m>\phi</m> extends to a unique isomorphism

          If <m>p(x)</m> has degree <m>n</m>,

          The fact that <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is an isomorphism could be checked by direct computation;

          This extension agrees with the original isomorphism <m>\phi : E \rightarrow F</m>,

    <title>Geometric Constructions</title>
    <introduction permid="Tof">
      <p permid="vhh">
        In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed.
        These problems are geometric in nature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school geometry;
        that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them.
        The problems can be stated as follows.

        <ol permid="gWl">
          <li permid="CEp">
            <p permid="pUy">
              Given an arbitrary angle,
              can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using only a straightedge and compass?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li permid="iLy">
            <p permid="WbH">
              Given an arbitrary circle,
              can one construct a square with the same area using only a straightedge and compass?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li permid="OSH">
            <p permid="CiQ">
              Given a cube,
              can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of the original?
              Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the construction.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years,
        each of these constructions was finally shown to be impossible.
        We will use the theory of fields to provide a proof that the solutions do not exist.
        It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these three geometric problems came from abstract algebra.
      </p>

      <p permid="boq">
        First, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a straightedge and compass,
        and also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth.
        To begin with, <em>a straightedge is not a ruler</em>.
        We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge.
        It is merely a tool for drawing a line through two points.
        The statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction.
        Certainly it is possible to trisect an angle in special cases.
        We can construct a <m>30^\circ</m> angle;
        hence, it is possible to trisect a <m>90^\circ</m> angle.
        However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a <m>20^\circ</m> angle.
        Therefore, we cannot trisect a <m>60^\circ</m> angle.

        Algebraic number theory uses the tools of algebra to solve problems in number theory.
        Modern algebraic number theory began with Pierre de Fermat
            <idx><h>Fermat, Pierre de</h></idx>
        (1601<ndash/>1665).
        Certainly we can find many positive integers that satisfy the equation
        <m>x^2 + y^2 = z^2</m>; Fermat conjectured that the equation
        <m>x^n + y^n = z^n</m> has no positive integer solutions for <m>n \geq 3</m>.
        He stated in the margin of his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus' <pubtitle>Arithmetica</pubtitle> that he had found a marvelous proof of this theorem,
        but that the margin of the book was too narrow to contain it.
        Building on work of other mathematicians,
        it was Andrew Wiles who finally succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem in the 1990s.
        Wiles's achievement was reported on the front page of the <pubtitle>New York Times</pubtitle>.

        So we asked for the roots of a polynomial over the rationals,
        but requested any root that may lie outside the rationals and within the field of algebraic numbers.
        Since the field of algebraic numbers contains all such roots,
        we get a full four roots of the fourth-degree polynomial.
        These roots are computed to lie within an interval and the question mark indicates that the preceding digits are accurate.
        (The integers paired with each root are the multiplicities of that root.

          The polynomial <m>r(x)=x^4+2x+2</m> is irreducible over the rationals (Eisenstein's criterion with prime <m>p=2</m>).
          Create a number field that contains a root of <m>r(x)</m>.
          By <xref ref="theorem-finite-extension"/>,
          and the remark following,
          every element of this finite field extension is an algebraic number,
          and hence satisfies some polynomial over the base field (it is this polynomial that Sage will produce with the <c>.minpoly()</c>method).
          This exercise will show how we can use just linear algebra to determine this minimal polynomial.

          Suppose that <c>a</c>is the generator of the number field you just created with <m>r(x)</m>.

          According to the proof, the first five powers of <c>t</c>
          (start counting from zero)
          will be linearly dependent. (Why?) So a nontrivial relation of linear dependence on these powers will provide the coefficients of a polynomial with <c>t</c>as a root.
          Compute these five powers,
