	<title>Fields</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>It is natural to ask whether or not some field <m>F</m> is contained in a larger field.  We think of the rational numbers, which reside inside the real numbers, while in turn, the real numbers live inside the complex numbers.  We can also study the fields between <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and <m>{\mathbb R}</m> and inquire as to the nature of these fields.</p>

		<p>More specifically if we are given a field <m>F</m> and a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>, we can ask whether or not we can find a field <m>E</m> containing <m>F</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> factors into linear factors over <m>E[x]</m>.  For example, if we consider the polynomial  
			<me>p(x) = x^4 -5 x^2 + 6</me>
		in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>,  then <m>p(x)</m> factors as <m>(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)</m>. However, both of these factors are irreducible in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>. If we wish to find a zero of <m>p(x)</m>, we must go to a larger field. Certainly the field of real numbers will work, since
			<me>p(x) = (x - \sqrt{2} ) (x + \sqrt{2} )( x - \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{3}).</me>
		It is possible to find a smaller field in which <m>p(x)</m> has a zero, namely 
			<me>{\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} ) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}.</me>
		We wish to be able to compute and study such fields for arbitrary polynomials over a field <m>F</m>. </p>

		<title>Extension Fields</title>

		<introduction>

			<p>A field <m>E</m> is an <term>extension field</term><index><main>Extension</main><sub>field</sub></index><index><main>Field</main><sub>extension</sub></index> of a field <m>F</m> if <m>F</m> is a subfield of <m>E</m>. The field <m>F</m> is called the <term>base field</term><index><main>Field</main><sub>base</sub></index>.  We write <m>F \subset E</m>.</p>

			<example xml:id="example-field-q-sqrt2">
				<p>For example, let 
					<me>F = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{2}\,) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}</me>
				and let <m>E =  {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} +  \sqrt{3}\,)</m> be the smallest field containing both <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m>. Both <m>E</m> and <m>F</m> are extension fields of the rational numbers. We claim that <m>E</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m>. To see this, we need only show that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is in <m>E</m>. Since <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is in <m>E</m>, <m>1 / (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,) = \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m> must also be in <m>E</m>. Taking linear combinations of <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m>, we find that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3}</m> must both be in <m>E</m>.</p>
			</example>

			<example xml:id="example-finite-field-4">
				<p>Let <m>p(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>. Since neither 0 nor 1 is a root of this polynomial, we know that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>. We will construct a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>. By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly" />, the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is maximal; hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.  Let <m>f(x) + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> be an arbitrary element of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m>. By the division algorithm,   
					<me>f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1) q(x) + r(x),</me>
				where the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>. Therefore, 
					<me>f(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle = r(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle.</me>
				The only possibilities for <m>r(x)</m> are then <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>1 + x</m>. Consequently, <m>E = {\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with four elements and must be a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>, containing a zero <m>\alpha</m> of <m>p(x)</m>. The field <m>{\mathbb Z}_2(  \alpha)</m> consists of elements  
					<md>

						<mrow>1 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 1</mrow>
						<mrow>0 + 1 \alpha &amp; = \alpha</mrow>
						<mrow>1 + 1 \alpha &amp; = 1 + \alpha.</mrow>
					</md>
				Notice that <m>{\alpha}^2 + {\alpha} + 1 = 0</m>; hence, if we compute <m>(1 + \alpha)^2</m>,  
					<me>(1 + \alpha)(1 + \alpha)= 1 + \alpha + \alpha + (\alpha)^2 = \alpha.</me>
				Other calculations are accomplished in a similar manner.  We summarize these computations in the following tables, which tell us how to add and multiply elements in <m>E</m>.</p>

			<p>The following theorem, due to Kronecker, is so important and so basic  to our understanding of fields that it is often known as the Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory.</p>
	 
			<theorem xml:id="theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory">
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>p(x)</m> be a nonconstant polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>.  Then there exists an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> and an  element <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>To prove this theorem, we will employ the method that we used to construct Example<nbsp /><xref ref="example-finite-field-4" />. Clearly, we can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is an irreducible polynomial. We wish to find an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>. The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is a maximal ideal in <m>F[x]</m> by Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly" />; hence, <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field. We claim that <m>E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is the desired field.</p> 

					<p>We first show that <m>E</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>. We can define a homomorphism of commutative rings by the map <m>\psi:F \rightarrow F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>, where <m>\psi(a) = a + \langle p(x)\rangle</m> for <m>a \in F</m>. It is easy to check that <m>\psi</m>is indeed a ring homomorphism.  Observe that 
						<me>\psi( a ) + \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle) + (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = (a + b) + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a + b )</me>
					and
						<me>\psi( a )  \psi( b ) = (a  + \langle p(x) \rangle)  (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = a  b  + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a  b ).</me>
					To prove that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one, assume that
						<me>a + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi(a) = \psi(b) = b + \langle p(x) \rangle.</me>
					Then <m>a - b</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>, since it lives in the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>. Since <m>p(x)</m> is a nonconstant polynomial, the only possibility is that <m>a - b = 0</m>. Consequently, <m>a = b</m> and <m>\psi</m> is injective. Since <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one, we can identify <m>F</m> with the subfield <m>\{ a + \langle p(x) \rangle : a \in F \}</m> of <m>E</m> and view <m>E</m> as an extension field of <m>F</m>.</p>
	 
	 <!-- \alpha is in E not F - TWJ 4/23/2011 -->

					<p>It remains for us to prove that <m>p(x)</m> has a zero <m>\alpha \in E</m>. Set <m>\alpha = x + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>. Then <m>\alpha</m> is in <m>E</m>. If <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</m>, then
						<md>
							<mrow>p( \alpha ) &amp; =  a_0 + a_1( x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + a_n ( x + \langle p(x) \rangle)^n</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; = a_0 + ( a_1 x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + (a_n  x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle)</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; = 0 + \langle p(x) \rangle.</mrow>
						</md>
					Therefore, we have found an element <m>\alpha \in E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> such that <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>p(x)</m>.</p>
				</proof>
			</theorem>

			<example xml:id="example-finite-field-8">
				<p>Let <m>p(x) = x^5 + x^4 + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>. Then <m>p(x)</m> has irreducible factors <m>x^2 + x + 1</m> and <m>x^3 + x + 1</m>. For a field extension <m>E</m> of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> has a root in <m>E</m>, we can let <m>E</m> be either <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> or <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle</m>.  We will leave it as an exercise to show that <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with <m>2^3=8</m> elements.</p>

				<p>Both <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>i</m> are algebraic over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> since they are zeros of the polynomials <m>x^2 -2</m> and <m>x^2 + 1</m>, respectively. Clearly <m>\pi</m> and <m>e</m> are algebraic over the real numbers; however, it is a nontrivial fact that they are transcendental over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.

			<example xml:id="example-field-sqrt2-sqrt3">
				<p>We will show that <m>\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3} }</m> is algebraic over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>. If <m>\alpha = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3} }</m>, then <m>\alpha^2 = 2 + \sqrt{3}</m>.

			<p>It is very easy to give an example of an extension field <m>E</m> over a field <m>F</m>, where <m>E</m> contains an element transcendental over <m>F</m>. The following theorem characterizes transcendental extensions.</p>
 
			<theorem>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>E</m> be an extension field of <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha \in E</m>. Then <m>\alpha</m> is transcendental over <m>F</m> if and only if <m>F( \alpha )</m> is isomorphic to <m>F(x)</m>, the field of fractions of <m>F[x]</m>.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E</m> be the evaluation homomorphism for <m>\alpha</m>. Then <m>\alpha</m> is transcendental over  <m>F</m> if and only if <m>\phi_{\alpha} (p(x)) = p(\alpha) \neq 0</m> for all  nonconstant polynomials <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>.  This is true if and only  if <m>\ker \phi_{\alpha} = \{ 0 \}</m>; that is, it is true exactly when  <m>\phi_{\alpha}</m> is one-to-one. Hence, <m>E</m> must contain a copy of <m>F[x]</m>.  The smallest field containing <m>F[x]</m> is the field of fractions <m>F(x)</m>.  By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-field-of-quotients" />, <m>E</m> must contain a copy of this field.</p>
				</proof>
			</theorem>
 
			<p>We have a more interesting situation in the case of algebraic extensions.</p>

			<theorem>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>E</m> be an extension field of a field <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha \in E</m> with <m>\alpha</m> algebraic over <m>F</m>. Then there is a unique irreducible monic polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> of smallest degree such that <m>p( \alpha ) = 0</m>. If <m>f(x)</m> is another polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> such that  <m>f(\alpha) = 0</m>, then <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.</p>
				</statement>

<!--  Removed the hypothesis that f(x) be monic.  Suggested by Davis Schubert. - TWJ 4/24/2013 -->
 
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E</m> be the evaluation homomorphism. The kernel of <m>\phi_{\alpha}</m> is a principal ideal generated by some <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> with <m>\deg p(x) \geq 1</m>. We know that such a polynomial exists, since <m>F[x]</m> is a principal ideal domain and <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic. The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> consists exactly of those elements of <m>F[x]</m> having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero. If <m>( \alpha ) = 0</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is not the zero polynomial, then <m>f(x) \in \langle p(x) \rangle</m> and <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>. So <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial of minimal degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero. Any other polynomial of the same degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero must have the form <m>\beta p( x)</m> for some <m>\beta \in F</m>.</p>
 
					<p>Suppose now that <m>p(x) = r(x) s(x)</m> is a factorization of <m>p</m> into polynomials of lower degree. Since <m>p( \alpha ) = 0</m>, <m>r( \alpha ) s( \alpha ) = 0</m>; consequently, either <m>r( \alpha )=0</m> or <m>s( \alpha ) = 0</m>, which contradicts the fact that <m>p</m> is of minimal degree. Therefore, <m>p(x)</m> must be irreducible.</p>
				</proof>
			</theorem>

			<p>Let <m>E</m> be an extension field of <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha \in E</m> be algebraic over <m>F</m>.

				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Since <m>\phi_{\alpha} ( F[x] ) \cong F( \alpha )</m>,  every element in <m>E = F( \alpha )</m> must be of the form <m>\phi_{\alpha} ( f(x) ) = f( \alpha )</m>, where <m>f(\alpha)</m> is a polynomial in <m>\alpha</m> with coefficients in <m>F</m>. Let

					Continuing in this manner, we can express every monomial <m>{\alpha}^m</m>, <m>m \geq n</m>, as a linear combination of powers of <m>{\alpha}</m> that are less than <m>n</m>. Hence, any <m>\beta \in F( \alpha )</m> can be written as

				<p>Since <m>x^2 + 1</m> is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb R}</m>, <m>\langle x^2 + 1 \rangle</m> is a maximal ideal in <m>{\mathbb R}[x]</m>.

				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>\{ \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \}</m> be a basis for <m>E</m> as a vector space over <m>F</m> and <m>\{ \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_m \}</m> be a basis for <m>K</m> as a vector space over <m>E</m>. We claim that <m>\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}</m> is a basis for <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>.  We will first show that these vectors span <m>K</m>. Let <m>u \in K</m>. Then <m>u = \sum_{j = 1}^{m} b_j \beta_j</m> and <m>b_j = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ij} \alpha_i</m>, where <m>b_j \in E</m> and <m>a_{ij} \in F</m>. Then

					So the <m>mn</m> vectors <m>\alpha_i \beta_j</m> must span <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>.</p>

					<p>We must show that <m>\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}</m> are linearly independent. Recall that a set of vectors <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n</m> in a vector space <m>V</m> are linearly independent if 
						<me>c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots + c_n v_n = 0</me>
					implies that
						<me>c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0.</me>
					Let 
						<me>u = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} ( \alpha_i \beta_j ) = 0</me>
					for <m>c_{ij} \in F</m>. We need to prove that all of the <m>c_{ij}</m>'s are zero. We can rewrite <m>u</m> as
						<me>\sum_{j = 1}^{m} \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{ij} \alpha_i \right) \beta_j = 0,</me>
					where <m>\sum_i c_{ij} \alpha_i \in E</m>.  Since the <m>\beta_j</m>'s are linearly independent over <m>E</m>, it must be the case that 
						<me>\sum_{i = 1}^n c_{ij} \alpha_i = 0</me>
					for all <m>j</m>. However, the <m>\alpha_j</m> are also linearly independent  over <m>F</m>.  Therefore, <m>c_{ij} = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>, which completes the proof.</p>

					<me>E = K(\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n) = F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n)</me>
				is a splitting field of <m>p(x)</m>.</p>

		</theorem>

		<p>The question of uniqueness now arises for splitting fields. This question is answered in the affirmative. Given two splitting fields <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> of a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>, there exists a field isomorphism <m>\phi : K \rightarrow L</m> that preserves <m>F</m>. In order to prove this result, we must first prove a lemma.</p>

		<lemma xml:id="lemma-field-isomorphism">
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>\phi : E \rightarrow F</m> be an isomorphism of fields. Let <m>K</m> be an extension field of <m>E</m> and <m>\alpha \in K</m> be algebraic over <m>E</m> with minimal polynomial <m>p(x)</m>. Suppose that <m>L</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m> such that <m>\beta</m> is root of the polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> obtained from <m>p(x)</m> under the image of <m>\phi</m>.  Then <m>\phi</m> extends to a unique isomorphism <m>\psi : E( \alpha ) \rightarrow F( \beta )</m> such that <m>\psi( \alpha ) = \beta</m> and <m>\psi</m> agrees with <m>\phi</m> on <m>E</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>If <m>p(x)</m> has degree <m>n</m>, then by Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-simple_extension" /> we can write any element in <m>E( \alpha )</m> as a linear combination of <m>1, \alpha, \ldots, \alpha^{n - 1}</m>. Therefore, the isomorphism that we are seeking must be   
					<me>\psi( a_0 + a_1 \alpha + \cdots + a_{n - 1} \alpha^{n - 1}) = \phi(a_0) + \phi(a_1) \beta + \cdots + \phi(a_{n - 1}) \beta^{n - 1},</me>
				where 
					<me>a_0 + a_1 \alpha + \cdots + a_{n - 1} \alpha^{n - 1}</me>
				is an element in <m>E(\alpha)</m>. The fact that <m>\psi</m> is an isomorphism could be checked by direct computation; however, it is easier to observe that <m>\psi</m> is a composition of maps that we already know to be isomorphisms.</p>

				<p>We can extend <m>\phi</m> to be an isomorphism from <m>E[x]</m> to <m>F[x]</m>, which we will also denote by <m>\phi</m>, by letting
					<me>\phi( a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n ) =  \phi( a_0 ) + \phi(a_1) x + \cdots + \phi(a_n) x^n.</me>
				This extension agrees with the original isomorphism <m>\phi : E \rightarrow F</m>, since constant polynomials get mapped to constant polynomials.  By assumption, <m>\phi(p(x)) = q(x)</m>; hence, <m>\phi</m> maps <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> onto <m>\langle q(x) \rangle</m>. Consequently, we have an isomorphism <m>\overline{\phi} : E[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle \rightarrow F[x]/\langle q(x) \rangle</m>. By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="proposition-minimal-poly" />, we have isomorphisms <m>\sigma: E[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle \rightarrow F(\alpha)</m> and <m>\tau : F[x]/\langle q(x) \rangle \rightarrow F( \beta )</m>, defined by evaluation at <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>, respectively. Therefore, <m>\psi = \tau^{-1} \overline{\phi} \sigma</m> is the required isomorphism.</p>

		<title>Geometric Constructions</title>

		<introduction>

			<p>In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed. These problems are geometric in nature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school geometry; that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them. The problems can be stated as follows.    
				<ol>

					<li>Given an arbitrary angle, can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using only a straightedge and compass?</li>

					<li>Given an arbitrary circle, can one construct a square with the same area using only a straightedge and compass?</li>

					<li>Given a cube, can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of the original? Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the construction.</li>

				</ol>
			After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years, each of these constructions was finally shown to be impossible.  We will use the theory of fields to provide a proof that the solutions do not exist.  It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these three geometric problems came from abstract algebra.</p>

			<p>First, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a straightedge and compass, and also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth.  To begin with, <em>a straightedge is not a ruler</em>. We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge. It is merely a tool for drawing a line through two points. The statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction. Certainly it is possible to trisect an angle in special cases.  We can construct a <m>30^\circ</m> angle; hence, it is possible to trisect a <m>90^\circ</m> angle.  However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a  <m>20^\circ</m> angle.  Therefore, we cannot trisect a <m>60^\circ</m> angle.</p>

			<title>Constructible Numbers</title>

				<statement>
					<p>The set of all constructible real numbers forms a subfield <m>F</m> of the field of real numbers.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> be constructible numbers.  We must show that <m>\alpha + \beta</m>, <m>\alpha - \beta</m>, <m>\alpha \beta</m>, and $\alpha / \beta<m> (</m>\beta \neq 0$) are also constructible numbers. We can assume that both <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are positive with <m>\alpha \gt \beta</m>. It is quite obvious how to construct <m>\alpha + \beta</m> and <m>\alpha - \beta</m>. To find a line segment with length <m>\alpha \beta</m>, we assume that <m>\beta \gt 1</m> and construct the triangle in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-multiplication-construction" /> such that triangles <m>\triangle ABC</m> and <m>\triangle ADE</m> are similar. Since <m>\alpha / 1 = x / \beta</m>, the line segment <m>x</m> has length <m>\alpha \beta</m>.  A similar construction can be made if <m>\beta \lt 1</m>. We will leave it as an exercise to show that the same triangle can be used to construct <m>\alpha / \beta</m> for <m>\beta \neq 0</m>.</p>

			<p>By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-constructible-numbers" />, we can locate in the plane any point <m>P =( p, q)</m> that has rational coordinates <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>. We need to know what other points can be constructed with a compass and straightedge from points with rational coordinates.</p>

			<lemma>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>F</m> be a subfield of <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
						<ol>

							<li>If a line contains two points in <m>F</m>, then it has the equation <m>a x + by + c = 0</m>, where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are in <m>F</m>.</li>

							<li>If a circle has a center at a point with coordinates in <m>F</m> and a radius that is also in <m>F</m>, then it has the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 + d x + e y + f = 0</m>, where <m>d</m>, <m>e</m>, and <m>f</m> are in <m>F</m>.</li>

						</ol></p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2, y_2)</m> be points on a line whose coordinates are in <m>F</m>.  If <m>x_1 = x_2</m>, then the equation of the line through the two points is <m>x - x_1 = 0</m>, which has the form <m>a x + by + c = 0</m>.  If <m>x_1 \neq x_2</m>, then the equation of the line through the two points is given by  
						<me>y - y_1 = \left( \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \right) (x - x_1),</me>
					which can also be put into the proper form.</p>

					<p>To prove the second part of the lemma, suppose that <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> is the center of a circle of radius <m>r</m>.  Then the circle has the equation
						<me>(x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2 - r^2 = 0.</me>
					This equation can easily be put into the appropriate form.</p>
				</proof>
			</lemma>

			<p>Starting with a field of constructible numbers <m>F</m>, we have three possible ways of constructing additional points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m> with a compass and straightedge. 
				<ol>

					<li>To find possible new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m>, we can take the intersection of two lines, each of which passes through two known points with coordinates in <m>F</m>.</li>

					<li>The intersection of a line that passes through two points that have coordinates in <m>F</m> and a circle whose center has coordinates in <m>F</m> with radius of a length in <m>F</m> will give new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.</li>

					<li>We can obtain new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m> by intersecting two circles whose centers have coordinates in <m>F</m> and whose radii are of lengths in <m>F</m>.</li>

				</ol>
 			The first case gives no new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m>, since the solution of two equations of the form <m>a x + by + c = 0</m> having coefficients in <m>F</m> will always be in <m>F</m>. The third case can be reduced to the second case.  Let
				<md>
					<mrow>x^2 + y^2 + d_1 x +e_1 y + f_1 = 0</mrow>
					<mrow>x^2 + y^2 + d_2 x +e_2 y + f_2 = 0</mrow>
				</md> <!-- corrected equation - 28 April 2012 - TWJ -->
			be the equations of two circles, where <m>d_i</m>, <m>e_i</m>, and <m>f_i</m> are in <m>F</m> for <m>i = 1, 2</m>. These circles have the same intersection as the circle  
				<me>x^2 + y^2 + d_1 x +e_1 x + f_1 = 0 </me>
			and the line
				<me>(d_1 - d_2) x + b(e_2 - e_1)y + (f_2 - f_1) = 0.</me>
			The last equation is that of the chord passing through the intersection points of the two circles. Hence, the intersection of two circles can be reduced to the case of an intersection of a line with a circle.</p>

			<p>Considering the case of the intersection of a line and a circle, we must determine the nature of the solutions of the equations
				<md>
					<mrow>a x + by + c &amp; = 0</mrow>
					<mrow>x^2 + y^2 + d x + e y + f &amp; = 0.</mrow>

			If we eliminate <m>y</m> from these equations, we obtain an equation of the form <m>Ax^2 + B x + C = 0</m>, where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are in <m>F</m>. The <m>x</m> coordinate of the intersection points is given by

			<title>Doubling the Cube and Squaring the Circle</title>
 
			<p>We are now ready to investigate the classical problems of doubling the cube and squaring the circle. We can use the field of constructible numbers to show exactly when a particular geometric construction can be accomplished.</p>   

			<p><em>Doubling the cube is impossible</em><index><main>Doubling the cube</main></index>. Given the edge of the cube, it is impossible to construct with a straightedge and compass the edge of the cube that has twice the volume of the original cube.

However, <m>\sqrt[3]{2}</m> is a zero of the irreducible polynomial <m>x^3 -2</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>; hence,

Certainly we can find many positive integers that satisfy the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = z^2</m>; Fermat conjectured that the equation <m>x^n + y^n = z^n</m> has no positive integer solutions for <m>n \geq 3</m>.  He stated in the margin of his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus' <title>Arithmetica</title> that he had found a marvelous proof of this theorem, but that the margin of the book was too narrow to contain it.    Building on work of other mathematicians, it was Andrew Wiles who finally succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem in the 1990s. Wiles's achievement was reported on the front page of the <title>New York Times</title>.</p>

			<p>Attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem have led to important contributions to algebraic number theory by such notable mathematicians as Leonhard Euler<index><main>Euler, Leonhard</main></index> (1707<ndash />1783). Significant advances in the understanding of Fermat's Last Theorem were made by Ernst Kummer<index><main>Kummer, Ernst</main></index> (1810<ndash />1893). Kummer's student, Leopold \mbox{Kronecker}<index><main>Kronecker, Leopold</main></index> (1823<ndash />1891), became one of the leading algebraists of the nineteenth century. Kronecker's theory of  ideals and his study of algebraic number theory added much to the understanding of fields.</p>

			<p>David Hilbert<index><main>Hilbert, David</main></index> (1862<ndash />1943) and Hermann Minkowski<index><main>Minkowski, Hermann</main></index> (1864<ndash />1909) were among the mathematicians who led the way in this subject at the beginning of the twentieth century.  Hilbert and Minkowski were both mathematicians at Göttingen University in Germany. Göttingen was truly one the most important centers of mathematical research during the last two centuries. The large number of exceptional mathematicians who studied there included Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann, Dedekind, Noether, and Weyl.</p>

			<p>André Weil<index><main>Weil, André</main></index> answered questions in number theory using algebraic geometry, a field of mathematics that studies geometry by studying commutative rings. From about 1955 to 1970, A. Grothendieck<index><main>Grothendieck, A.</main></index> dominated the field of algebraic geometry. Pierre Deligne<index><main>Deligne, Pierre</main></index>, a student of Grothendieck, solved several of Weil's number-theoretic conjectures. One of the most recent contributions to algebra and number theory is Gerd Falting's<index><main>Faltings, Gerd</main></index> proof of the Mordell-Weil conjecture<index><main>Mordell-Weil conjecture</main></index>. This conjecture of Mordell and Weil essentially says that certain polynomials <m>p(x, y)</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x,y]</m> have only a finite number of integral solutions.</p>
