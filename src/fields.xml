  <title>Fields</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      It is natural to ask whether or not some field <m>F</m> is contained in a larger field.
      We think of the rational numbers,
      which reside inside the real numbers,
      while in turn, the real numbers live inside the complex numbers.
      We can also study the fields between <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and
      <m>{\mathbb R}</m> and inquire as to the nature of these fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      More specifically if we are given a field <m>F</m> and a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>,
      we can ask whether or not we can find a field <m>E</m> containing <m>F</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> factors into linear factors over <m>E[x]</m>.
      For example, if we consider the polynomial
      <me>
        p(x) = x^4 -5 x^2 + 6
      </me>
      in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>,
      then <m>p(x)</m> factors as <m>(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)</m>.
      However, both of these factors are irreducible in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>.
      If we wish to find a zero of <m>p(x)</m>,
      we must go to a larger field.
      Certainly the field of real numbers will work, since
      <me>
        p(x) = (x - \sqrt{2} ) (x + \sqrt{2} )( x - \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{3})
      </me>.
      It is possible to find a smaller field in which <m>p(x)</m> has a zero, namely
      <me>
        {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} ) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}
      </me>.
      We wish to be able to compute and study such fields for arbitrary polynomials over a field <m>F</m>.

    <title>Extension Fields</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        A field <m>E</m> is an <term>extension field</term><idx><h>Extension</h><h>field</h></idx><idx><h>Field</h><h>extension</h></idx>
        of a field <m>F</m> if <m>F</m> is a subfield of <m>E</m>.
        The field <m>F</m> is called the <idx><h>Field</h><h>base</h></idx><term>base field</term>.
        We write <m>F \subset E</m>.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="fields-example-q-sqrt2">
        <p>
          For example, let
          <me>
            F = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{2}\,) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}
          </me>
          and let <m>E =  {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,)</m> be the smallest field containing both
          <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m>.
          Both <m>E</m> and <m>F</m> are extension fields of the rational numbers.
          We claim that <m>E</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m>.
          To see this,
          we need only show that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is in <m>E</m>.
          Since <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is in <m>E</m>,
          <m>1 / (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,) = \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m> must also be in <m>E</m>.
          Taking linear combinations of
          <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m>,
          we find that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and
          <m>\sqrt{3}</m> must both be in <m>E</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="fields-example-finite-f4">
        <p>
          Let <m>p(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>.
          Since neither 0 nor 1 is a root of this polynomial,
          we know that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
          We will construct a field extension of
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
          By <xref ref="poly-theorem-max-ideal"/>,
          the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is maximal;
          hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
          Let <m>f(x) + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> be an arbitrary element of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
          By the division algorithm,
          <me>
            f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1) q(x) + r(x)
          </me>,
          where the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>.
          Therefore,
          <me>
            f(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle = r(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle
          </me>.
          The only possibilities for <m>r(x)</m> are then <m>0</m>,
          <m>1</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>1 + x</m>.
          Consequently,
          <m>E = {\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with four elements and must be a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
          containing a zero <m>\alpha</m> of <m>p(x)</m>.
          The field <m>{\mathbb Z}_2(  \alpha)</m> consists of elements
          <md>
            <mrow>0 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 0</mrow>
            <mrow>1 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 1</mrow>
            <mrow>0 + 1 \alpha &amp; = \alpha</mrow>
            <mrow>1 + 1 \alpha &amp; = 1 + \alpha</mrow>
          </md>.
          Notice that <m>{\alpha}^2 + {\alpha} + 1 = 0</m>;
          hence, if we compute <m>(1 + \alpha)^2</m>,
          <me>
            (1 + \alpha)(1 + \alpha)= 1 + \alpha + \alpha + (\alpha)^2 = \alpha
          </me>.
          Other calculations are accomplished in a similar manner.
          We summarize these computations in the following tables,
          which tell us how to add and multiply elements in <m>E</m>.

        The following theorem, due to Kronecker,
        is so important and so basic to our understanding of fields that it is often known as the Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="fields-theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>p(x)</m> be a nonconstant polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>.
            Then there exists an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> and an element
            <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            To prove this theorem,
            we will employ the method that we used to construct <xref ref="fields-example-finite-f4"/>.
            Clearly, we can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is an irreducible polynomial.
            We wish to find an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
            The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is a maximal ideal in <m>F[x]</m> by <xref ref="poly-theorem-max-ideal"/>;
            hence, <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
            We claim that <m>E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is the desired field.
          </p>

          <p>
            We first show that <m>E</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.
            We can define a homomorphism of commutative rings by the map <m>\psi:F \rightarrow F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>,
            where <m>\psi(a) = a + \langle p(x)\rangle</m> for <m>a \in F</m>.
            It is easy to check that <m>\psi</m> is indeed a ring homomorphism.
            Observe that
            <me>
              \psi( a ) + \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle) + (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = (a + b) + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a + b )
            </me>
            and
            <me>
              \psi( a ) \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle)  (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = ab + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( ab )
            </me>.
            To prove that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one, assume that
            <me>
              a + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi(a) = \psi(b) = b + \langle p(x) \rangle
            </me>.
            Then <m>a - b</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>,
            since it lives in the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
            Since <m>p(x)</m> is a nonconstant polynomial,
            the only possibility is that <m>a - b = 0</m>.
            Consequently, <m>a = b</m> and <m>\psi</m> is injective.
            Since <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one,
            we can identify <m>F</m> with the subfield
            <m>\{ a + \langle p(x) \rangle : a \in F \}</m> of <m>E</m> and view <m>E</m> as an extension field of <m>F</m>.
          </p>
            <!-- \alpha is in E not F - TWJ 4/23/2011 -->
          <p>
            It remains for us to prove that <m>p(x)</m> has a zero <m>\alpha \in E</m>.
            Set <m>\alpha = x + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
            Then <m>\alpha</m> is in <m>E</m>.
            If <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</m>, then
            <md>
              <mrow>p( \alpha ) &amp; =  a_0 + a_1( x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + a_n ( x + \langle p(x) \rangle)^n</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + ( a_1 x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + (a_n  x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle)</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = 0 + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
            </md>.
            Therefore, we have found an element
            <m>\alpha \in E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> such that <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>p(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>

      <example xml:id="fields-example-finite-f8">
        <p>
          Let <m>p(x) = x^5 + x^4 + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>.
          Then <m>p(x)</m> has irreducible factors
          <m>x^2 + x + 1</m> and <m>x^3 + x + 1</m>.
          For a field extension <m>E</m> of
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> has a root in <m>E</m>,
          we can let <m>E</m> be either
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> or <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle</m>.
          We will leave it as an exercise to show that
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with <m>2^3 = 8</m> elements.

            Let <m>E</m> be an extension field of <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha \in E</m>.
            Then <m>\alpha</m> is transcendental over <m>F</m> if and only if

            Then there is a unique irreducible monic polynomial
            <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> of smallest degree such that <m>p( \alpha ) = 0</m>.
            If <m>f(x)</m> is another polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> such that <m>f(\alpha) = 0</m>,
            then <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E</m> be the evaluation homomorphism.
            The kernel of <m>\phi_{\alpha}</m> is a principal ideal generated by some
            <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> with <m>\deg p(x) \geq 1</m>.
            We know that such a polynomial exists,
            since <m>F[x]</m> is a principal ideal domain and <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic.
            The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> consists exactly of those elements of <m>F[x]</m> having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero.
            If <m>f( \alpha ) = 0</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is not the zero polynomial,
            then <m>f(x) \in \langle p(x) \rangle</m> and <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.
            So <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial of minimal degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero.
            Any other polynomial of the same degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero must have the form
            <m>\beta p( x)</m> for some <m>\beta \in F</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose now that <m>p(x) = r(x) s(x)</m> is a factorization of <m>p(x)</m> into polynomials of lower degree.
            Since <m>p( \alpha ) = 0</m>,
            <m>r( \alpha ) s( \alpha ) = 0</m>;
            consequently,
            either <m>r( \alpha )=0</m> or <m>s( \alpha ) = 0</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>p</m> is of minimal degree.
            Therefore, <m>p(x)</m> must be irreducible.

            be the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>.
            Then <m>p( \alpha ) = 0</m>; hence,

            is in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>g( \alpha ) = 0</m>.
            Since the degree of <m>g(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>p( x )</m>,
            the irreducible polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>,
            <m>g(x)</m> must be the zero polynomial.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\{ \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \}</m> be a basis for <m>E</m> as a vector space over <m>F</m> and
            <m>\{ \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_m \}</m> be a basis for <m>K</m> as a vector space over <m>E</m>.
            We claim that <m>\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}</m> is a basis for <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>.
            We will first show that these vectors span <m>K</m>.
            Let <m>u \in K</m>.
            Then <m>u = \sum_{j = 1}^{m} b_j \beta_j</m> and <m>b_j = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ij} \alpha_i</m>,

            Then

              u = \sum_{j = 1}^{m} \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ij} \alpha_i  \right) \beta_j = \sum_{i,j} a_{ij} ( \alpha_i \beta_j )

          <p>
            We must show that <m>\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}</m> are linearly independent.
            Recall that a set of vectors

            v_n</m> in a vector space <m>V</m> are linearly independent if

              c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots + c_n v_n = 0

            implies that
            <me>
              c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0
            </me>.
            Let
            <me>
              u = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} ( \alpha_i \beta_j ) = 0
            </me>
            for <m>c_{ij} \in F</m>.
            We need to prove that all of the <m>c_{ij}</m>'s are zero.
            We can rewrite <m>u</m> as
            <me>
              \sum_{j = 1}^{m} \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{ij} \alpha_i \right) \beta_j = 0
            </me>,
            where <m>\sum_i c_{ij} \alpha_i \in E</m>.
            Since the <m>\beta_j</m>'s are linearly independent over <m>E</m>,
            it must be the case that
            <me>
              \sum_{i = 1}^n c_{ij} \alpha_i = 0

            However, the <m>\alpha_j</m> are also linearly independent  over <m>F</m>.

          Let us determine an extension field of

          It is easy to determine that the minimal  polynomial of

          It follows that

            [{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}\, ) : {\mathbb Q} ] = 4
          </me>.
          We know that <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{3}\, \}</m> is a basis for 
          <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
          Hence, <m>\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}</m> cannot be in <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m>.
          It follows that <m>\sqrt{5}</m> cannot be in <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m> either.
          Therefore, <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{5}\, \}</m> is a basis for <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ) = ( {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}\, ))( \sqrt{5}\, )</m> over
          <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m> and <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{3} \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{15}\, \}</m> is a basis for
          <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ) = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}\, )</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
          This example shows that it is possible that some extension

          </me>.
          Notice that <m>\sqrt[6]{5}\, i</m> is a zero of <m>x^6 + 5</m>.
          We can show that this polynomial is irreducible over
          <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> using Eisenstein's Criterion,

          Assume that the theorem is true for all polynomials of degree <m>k</m> with
          <m>1 \leq k \lt n</m> and let <m>\deg p(x) = n</m>.
          We can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible;
          otherwise, by our induction hypothesis, we are done.
          By <xref ref="fields-theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory"/>,

    <p>
      The question of uniqueness now arises for splitting fields.
      This question is answered in the affirmative.
      Given two splitting fields <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> of a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>,
      there exists a field isomorphism
      <m>\phi : K \rightarrow L</m> that preserves <m>F</m>.
      In order to prove this result,
      we must first prove a lemma.
    </p>

    <lemma xml:id="fields-lemma-field-isomorphism">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\phi : E \rightarrow F</m> be an isomorphism of fields.
          Let <m>K</m> be an extension field of <m>E</m> and
          <m>\alpha \in K</m> be algebraic over <m>E</m> with minimal polynomial <m>p(x)</m>.
          Suppose that <m>L</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m> such that <m>\beta</m> is root of the polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> obtained from <m>p(x)</m> under the image of <m>\phi</m>.
          Then <m>\phi</m> extends to a unique isomorphism
          <m>\overline{\phi} : E( \alpha ) \rightarrow F( \beta )</m> such that <m>\overline{\phi}( \alpha ) = \beta</m> and
          <m>\overline{\phi}</m> agrees with <m>\phi</m> on <m>E</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          If <m>p(x)</m> has degree <m>n</m>,
          then by <xref ref="fields-theorem-simple_extension"/> we can write any element in
          <m>E( \alpha )</m> as a linear combination of <m>1, \alpha, \ldots, \alpha^{n - 1}</m>.
          Therefore, the isomorphism that we are seeking must be
          <me>
            \overline{\phi}( a_0 + a_1 \alpha + \cdots + a_{n - 1} \alpha^{n - 1}) = \phi(a_0) + \phi(a_1) \beta + \cdots + \phi(a_{n - 1}) \beta^{n - 1}
          </me>,
          where
          <me>
            a_0 + a_1 \alpha + \cdots + a_{n - 1} \alpha^{n - 1}
          </me>
          is an element in <m>E(\alpha)</m>.
          The fact that <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is an isomorphism could be checked by direct computation;
          however, it is easier to observe that
          <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is a composition of maps that we already know to be isomorphisms.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can extend <m>\phi</m> to be an isomorphism from <m>E[x]</m> to <m>F[x]</m>,
          which we will also denote by <m>\phi</m>, by letting
          <me>
            \phi( a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n ) =  \phi( a_0 ) + \phi(a_1) x + \cdots + \phi(a_n) x^n
          </me>.
          This extension agrees with the original isomorphism <m>\phi : E \rightarrow F</m>,
          since constant polynomials get mapped to constant polynomials.
          By assumption, <m>\phi(p(x)) = q(x)</m>;
          hence, <m>\phi</m> maps <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> onto <m>\langle q(x) \rangle</m>.
          Consequently,
          we have an isomorphism <m>\psi : E[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle \rightarrow F[x]/\langle q(x) \rangle</m>.
          By <xref ref="fields-proposition-minimal-poly"/>,
          we have isomorphisms <m>\sigma: E[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle \rightarrow E(\alpha)</m> and <m>\tau : F[x]/\langle q(x) \rangle \rightarrow F( \beta )</m>,
          defined by evaluation at <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>,
          respectively.
          Therefore, <m>\overline{\phi} = \tau \psi \sigma^{-1}</m> is the required isomorphism (see <xref ref="fields-figure-splitting-fields-1"/>).

    <title>Geometric Constructions</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed.
        These problems are geometric in nature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school geometry;
        that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them.
        The problems can be stated as follows.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Given an arbitrary angle,
              can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using only a straightedge and compass?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Given an arbitrary circle,
              can one construct a square with the same area using only a straightedge and compass?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Given a cube,
              can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of the original?
              Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the construction.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years,
        each of these constructions was finally shown to be impossible.
        We will use the theory of fields to provide a proof that the solutions do not exist.
        It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these three geometric problems came from abstract algebra.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a straightedge and compass,
        and also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth.
        To begin with, <em>a straightedge is not a ruler</em>.
        We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge.
        It is merely a tool for drawing a line through two points.
        The statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction.
        Certainly it is possible to trisect an angle in special cases.
        We can construct a <m>30^\circ</m> angle;
        hence, it is possible to trisect a <m>90^\circ</m> angle.
        However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a <m>20^\circ</m> angle.
        Therefore, we cannot trisect a <m>60^\circ</m> angle.
      </p>

    <subsection xml:id="fields-subsection-constructible-numbers">
      <title>Constructible Numbers</title>
      <p>
        A real number <m>\alpha</m> is <term>constructible</term><idx><h>Constructible number</h></idx>
        if we can construct a line segment of length
        <m>| \alpha |</m> in a finite number of steps from a segment of unit length by using a straightedge and compass.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> be constructible numbers.
            We must show that <m>\alpha + \beta</m>,
            <m>\alpha - \beta</m>, <m>\alpha \beta</m>,
            and <m>\alpha / \beta</m> (<m>\beta \neq 0</m>) are also constructible numbers.
            We can assume that both <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are positive with <m>\alpha \gt \beta</m>.
            It is quite obvious how to construct
            <m>\alpha + \beta</m> and <m>\alpha - \beta</m>.
            To find a line segment with length <m>\alpha \beta</m>,
            we assume that <m>\beta \gt 1</m> and construct the triangle in <xref ref="fields-figure-multiplication-construction"/> such that triangles
            <m>\triangle ABC</m> and <m>\triangle ADE</m> are similar.
            Since <m>\alpha / 1 = x / \beta</m>,
            the line segment <m>x</m> has length <m>\alpha \beta</m>.
            A similar construction can be made if <m>\beta \lt 1</m>.
            We will leave it as an exercise to show that the same triangle can be used to construct
            <m>\alpha / \beta</m> for <m>\beta \neq 0</m>.

              each of which passes through two known points with coordinates in <m>F</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The intersection of a line that passes through two points that have coordinates in <m>F</m> and a circle whose center has coordinates in <m>F</m> with radius of a length in <m>F</m> will give new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We can obtain new points in
              <m>{\mathbb R}</m> by intersecting two circles whose centers have coordinates in <m>F</m> and whose radii are of lengths in <m>F</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        The first case gives no new points in <m>{\mathbb R}</m>,
        since the solution of two equations of the form
        <m>a x + by + c = 0</m> having coefficients in <m>F</m> will always be in <m>F</m>.
        The third case can be reduced to the second case.
        Let
        <md>
          <mrow>x^2 + y^2 + d_1 x + e_1 y + f_1 = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>x^2 + y^2 + d_2 x + e_2 y + f_2 = 0</mrow>
        </md>
 <!-- corrected equation - 28 April 2012 - TWJ -->
        be the equations of two circles,
        where <m>d_i</m>, <m>e_i</m>,
        and <m>f_i</m> are in <m>F</m> for <m>i = 1, 2</m>.
        These circles have the same intersection as the circle
        <me>
          x^2 + y^2 + d_1 x +e_1 x + f_1 = 0
        </me>
        and the line
        <me>
          (d_1 - d_2) x + b(e_2 - e_1)y + (f_2 - f_1) = 0
        </me>.
        The last equation is that of the chord passing through the intersection points of the two circles.
        Hence, the intersection of two circles can be reduced to the case of an intersection of a line with a circle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Considering the case of the intersection of a line and a circle,
        we must determine the nature of the solutions of the equations
        <md>
          <mrow>a x + by + c &amp; = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>x^2 + y^2 + d x + e y + f &amp; = 0</mrow>
        </md>.
        If we eliminate <m>y</m> from these equations,
        we obtain an equation of the form <m>Ax^2 + B x + C = 0</m>,
        where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are in <m>F</m>.
        The <m>x</m> coordinate of the intersection points is given by
        <me>
          x = \frac{- B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4 A C} }{2 A}
        </me>
        and is in <m>F( \sqrt{\alpha}\, )</m>,
        where <m>\alpha = B^2 - 4 A C \gt 0</m>.

        We are now ready to investigate the classical problems of doubling the cube and squaring the circle.
        We can use the field of constructible numbers to show exactly when a particular geometric construction can be accomplished.

        <p>
          Given the edge of the cube,
          it is impossible to construct with a straightedge and compass the edge of the cube that has twice the volume of the original cube.
          Let the original cube have an edge of length <m>1</m> and,
          therefore, a volume of <m>1</m>.
          If we could construct a cube having a volume of <m>2</m>,
          then this new cube would have an edge of length <m>\sqrt[3]{2}</m>.
          However, <m>\sqrt[3]{2}</m> is a zero of the irreducible polynomial <m>x^3 -2</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>; hence,
          <me>
            [{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}\, ) : {\mathbb Q}] = 3
          </me>
          This is impossible, since <m>3</m> is not a power of <m>2</m>.

          Suppose that we have a circle of radius <m>1</m>.
          The area of the circle is <m>\pi</m>;

          This is impossible since <m>\pi</m> and consequently
          <m>\sqrt{\pi}</m> are both transcendental.
          Therefore, using a straightedge and compass,
          it is not possible to construct a square with the same area as the circle.

      <p>
        <em>Trisecting an arbitrary angle is impossible</em>.
        We will show that it is impossible to construct a <m>20^\circ</m> angle.
        Consequently, a <m>60^{\circ}</m> angle cannot be trisected.
        We first need to calculate the triple-angle formula for the cosine:
        <md>
          <mrow>\cos 3 \theta &amp; = \cos( 2 \theta + \theta )</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = \cos 2 \theta \cos \theta - \sin 2 \theta \sin \theta</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = ( 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1) \cos \theta - 2 \sin^2 \theta \cos \theta</mrow>

          <mrow>&amp; = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta</mrow>
        </md>.
        The angle <m>\theta</m> can be constructed if and only if <m>\alpha = \cos \theta</m> is constructible.
        Let <m>\theta = 20^{\circ}</m>.
        Then <m>\cos 3 \theta = \cos 60^\circ = 1/2</m>.
        By the triple-angle formula for the cosine,
        <me>
          4 \alpha^3 - 3 \alpha = \frac{1}{2}
        </me>.
        Therefore, <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>8 x^3 - 6 x -1</m>.
        This polynomial has no factors in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>,
        and hence is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>.
        Thus, <m>[{\mathbb Q}( \alpha ) : {\mathbb Q }] = 3</m>.
        Consequently, <m>\alpha</m> cannot be a constructible number.

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p>
        Algebraic number theory uses the tools of algebra to solve problems in number theory.
        Modern algebraic number theory began with Pierre de Fermat<idx><h>Fermat, Pierre de</h></idx>
        (1601<ndash/>1665).
        Certainly we can find many positive integers that satisfy the equation
        <m>x^2 + y^2 = z^2</m>; Fermat conjectured that the equation
        <m>x^n + y^n = z^n</m> has no positive integer solutions for <m>n \geq 3</m>.
        He stated in the margin of his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus' <pubtitle>Arithmetica</pubtitle> that he had found a marvelous proof of this theorem,
        but that the margin of the book was too narrow to contain it.
        Building on work of other mathematicians,
        it was Andrew Wiles who finally succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem in the 1990s.
        Wiles's achievement was reported on the front page of the <pubtitle>New York Times</pubtitle>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem have led to important contributions to algebraic number theory by such notable mathematicians as Leonhard Euler<idx><h>Euler, Leonhard</h></idx>
        (1707<ndash/>1783).
        Significant advances in the understanding of Fermat's Last Theorem were made by Ernst Kummer<idx><h>Kummer, Ernst</h></idx>
        (1810<ndash/>1893).
        Kummer's student, Leopold Kronecker<idx><h>Kronecker, Leopold</h></idx>
        (1823<ndash/>1891), became one of the leading algebraists of the nineteenth century.
        Kronecker's theory of ideals and his study of algebraic number theory added much to the understanding of fields.

      <p>
        David Hilbert<idx><h>Hilbert, David</h></idx>
        (1862<ndash/>1943) and Hermann Minkowski<idx><h>Minkowski, Hermann</h></idx>
        (1864<ndash/>1909) were among the mathematicians who led the way in this subject at the beginning of the twentieth century.
        Hilbert and Minkowski were both mathematicians at Göttingen University in Germany.
        Göttingen was truly one the most important centers of mathematical research during the last two centuries.
        The large number of exceptional mathematicians who studied there included Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann, Dedekind, Noether,
        and Weyl.

        From about 1955 to 1970, Alexander Grothendieck<idx><h>Grothendieck, Alexander</h></idx>

        a student of Grothendieck,
        solved several of Weil's number-theoretic conjectures.

        proof of the Mordell conjecture.<idx><h>Mordell conjecture</h></idx>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        In Sage, and other places,
        an extension of the rationals is called a <q>number field.</q>
        They are one of Sage's most mature features.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection>
      <title>Number Fields</title>
      <p>
        There are several ways to create a number field.
        We are familiar with the syntax where we adjoin an irrational number that we can write with traditional combinations of arithmetic and roots.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        M.&lt;a&gt; = QQ[sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)]; M
        </input>
                <output>
        Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^4 - 10*x^2 + 1
        with a = 3.146264369941973?
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        We can also specify the element we want to adjoin as the root of a monic irreducible polynomial.
        One approach is to construct the polynomial ring first so that the polynomial has the location of its coefficients specified properly.

      <p>
        Rather than building the whole polynomial ring,
        we can simply introduce a variable as the generator of a polynomial ring and then create polynomials from this variable.
        This spares us naming the polynomial ring.
        Notice in the example that both instances of <c>z</c> are necessary.

        We can recover the polynomial used to create a number field,
        even if we constructed it by giving an expression for an irrational element.
        In this case,
        the polynomial is the minimal polynomial of the element.

      <title>Relative and Absolute Number Fields</title>
      <p>
        With Sage we can adjoin several elements at once and we can build nested towers of number fields.
        Sage uses the term <q>absolute</q>
        to refer to a number field viewed as an extension of the rationals themselves,
        and the term <q>relative</q> to refer to a number field constructed,
        or viewed,
        as an extension of another (nontrivial) number field.
      </p>

        The number field <c>A</c> has been constructed mathematically as what we would write as <m>{\mathbb Q}\subset{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt{3}]\subset{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt{3},\sqrt{2}]</m>.
        Notice the slight difference in ordering of the elements we are adjoining,
        and notice how the number fields use slightly fancier internal names (<c>sqrt2</c>,
        <c>sqrt3</c>) for the new elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can <q>flatten</q> a relative field to view it as an absolute field,
        which may have been our intention from the start.
        Here we create a new number field from <c>A</c> that makes it a pure absolute number field.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        C.&lt;c&gt; = A.absolute_field()
        C

        Number Field in c with defining polynomial x^4 - 10*x^2 + 1
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Once we construct an absolute number field this way,
        we can recover isomorphisms to and from the absolute field.
        Recall that our tower was built with generators <c>a</c> and <c>b</c>,
        while the flattened tower is generated by <c>c</c>.
        The <c>.structure()</c> method returns a pair of functions,
        with the absolute number field as the domain and codomain
        (in that order).
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        fromC, toC = C.structure()
        fromC(c)
        </input>
                <output>

      <p>
        This tells us that the single generator of the flattened tower,
        <c>c</c>, is equal to <m>\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}</m>, and further,
        each of <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and
        <m>\sqrt{3}</m> can be expressed as polynomial functions of <c>c</c>.
        With these connections,
        you might want to compute the final two expressions in <c>c</c> by hand,
        and appreciate the work Sage does to determine these for us.
        This computation is an example of the conclusion of the upcoming <xref ref="galois-theorem-primitive-element"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many number field methods have both relative and absolute versions,
        and we will also find it more convenient to work in a tower or a flattened version,
        thus the isomorphisms between the two can be invaluable for translating both questions and answers.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a vector space over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>,
        or over another number field,
        number fields that are finite extensions have a dimension,
        called the degree.
        These are easy to get from Sage,
        though for a relative field,
        we need to be more precise about which degree we desire.

        Consider <m>p(x)=x^4+x^2-1</m>.
        We first build a number field with a single root,
        and then factor the polynomial over this new, larger, field.

      <p>
        So our polynomial factors partially into two linear factors and a quadratic factor.
        But notice that the quadratic factor has a coefficient that is irrational,
        <m>a^2+1</m>,
        so the quadratic factor properly belongs in the polynomial ring over <c>M</c> and not over <c>QQ</c>.

      <p>
        We build an extension containing a root of the quadratic factor,
        called <c>q</c> here.
        Then, rather than using the <c>polygen()</c> function,
        we build an entire polynomial ring <c>R</c> over <c>N</c> with the indeterminate <c>z</c>.
        The reason for doing this is we can illustrate how we <q>upgrade</q>
        the polynomial <c>p</c> with the syntax <c>R(p)</c> to go from having coefficients in <c>M</c> to having coefficients in <c>N</c>.

      <p>
        This is an interesting alternative,
        in that the roots of the polynomial are expressions in terms of the
        <em>single</em> generator <c>c</c>.
        Since the roots involve a seventh power of <c>c</c>, we might suspect
        (but not be certain)
        that the minimal polynomial of <c>c</c> has degree <m>8</m> and that <c>P</c> is a degree <m>8</m> extension of the rationals.
        Indeed <c>P</c>
        (or <c>N</c>)
        is a splitting field for <m>p(x)=x^4+x^2-1</m>.
        The roots are not really as bad as they appear <mdash/> lets convert them back to the relative number field.
      </p>

      <p>
        First we want to rewrite a single factor
        (the first)
        in the form <m>(w-r)</m> to identify the root with the correct signs.
      </p>

            <sage type="display">
                <input>
        (w -  7/18966*c^7 + 110/9483*c^5 + 923/9483*c^3 + 3001/6322*c) =
        (w - (7/18966*c^7 - 110/9483*c^5 - 923/9483*c^3 - 3001/6322*c))
        </input>
            </sage>

      <p>
        With the conversion isomorphisms,
        we can recognize the roots for what they are.

      <p>
        So the rather complicated expression in <c>c</c> is just the negative of the root we adjoined in the second step of constructing the tower of number fields.
        It would be a good exercise to see what happens to the other three roots
        (being careful to get the signs right on each root).

      <title>Algebraic Numbers</title>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fields-corollary-algebraic-numbers-field"/> says that the set of <em>all</em>
        algebraic numbers forms a field.
        This field is implemented in Sage as <c>QQbar</c>.
        This allows for finding roots of polynomials as exact quantities which display as inexact numbers.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
        p = x^4 + x^2 - 1
        r = p.roots(ring=QQbar); r

        So we asked for the roots of a polynomial over the rationals,
        but requested any root that may lie outside the rationals and within the field of algebraic numbers.
        Since the field of algebraic numbers contains all such roots,
        we get a full four roots of the fourth-degree polynomial.
        These roots are computed to lie within an interval and the question mark indicates that the preceding digits are accurate.
        (The integers paired with each root are the multiplicities of that root.
        Use the keyword <c>multiplicities=False</c> to turn them off.)
        Let us take a look under the hood and see how Sage manages the field of algebraic numbers.

        Three items are associated with this initial root.
        First is a number field,
        with generator <c>a</c> and a defining polynomial similar to the polynomial we are finding the roots of,
        but not identical.
        Second is an expression in the generator <c>a</c>, which is the actual root.
        You might evaluate this expression with the numerical approximation of <c>a</c>,
        coming next, to verify this is a root.
        Finally, there is a ring homomorphism from the number field to the
        <q>Algebraic Real Field</q>,
        <c>AA</c>, the subfield of <c>QQbar</c> with just real elements,
        which associates the generator <c>a</c> with the number <c>-1.272019649514069?</c>.
        Let us verify, in two ways, that the root given is really a root.
      </p>

        Now that we have enough theory to understand the field of algebraic numbers,
        and a natural way to represent them exactly,
        you might consider the operations in the field.
        If we take two algebraic numbers and add them together,
        we get another algebraic number (<xref ref="fields-corollary-algebraic-numbers-field"/>).
        So what is the resulting minimal polynomial?
        How is it computed in Sage?
        You could read the source code if you wanted the answer.

        Sage can do a lot of things,
        but it is not yet able to lay out lines with a straightedge and compass.
        However, we can very quickly determine that trisecting a <m>60</m> degree angle is impossible.
        We adjoin the cosine of a <m>20</m> degree angle
        (in radians)
        to the rationals, determine the degree of the extension,
        and check that it is not an integer power of <m>2</m>.
        In one line.
        Sweet.

          Create the polynomial <m>p(x)=x^5+2x^4+1</m> over <m>{\mathbb Z}_3</m>.
          Verify that it does not have any linear factors by evaluating <m>p(x)</m> with each element of <m>{\mathbb Z}_3</m>,

          Recreate <m>p(x)</m> as a polynomial over this field.
          Check each of the <m>3^5 = 243</m> elements of the field to see if they are roots of the polynomial and list all of the elements which are roots.
          Finally, request that Sage give a factorization of <m>p(x)</m> over the field,
          and comment on the relationship between your list of roots and your factorization.

        <p>
          This problem continues the previous one.
          Build the ring of polynomials over
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_3</m> and within this ring use <m>p(x)</m> to generate a principal ideal.
          Finally construct the quotient of the polynomial ring by the ideal.
          Since the polynomial is irreducible,
          this quotient ring is a field,
          and by <xref ref="fields-proposition-minimal-poly"/> this quotient ring is isomorphic to the number field in the previous problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Borrowing from your results in the previous question,
          construct five roots of the polynomial <m>p(x)</m> within this quotient ring,
          but now as expressions in the generator of the quotient ring
          (which is technically a coset).
          Use Sage to verify that they are indeed roots.
          This demonstrates using a quotient ring to create a splitting field for an irreducible polynomial over a finite field.

    <exercise number="3" xml:id="fields-sage-exercise-finite-extension">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The subsection <xref ref="fields-subsection-algebraic-elements" text="title"/> relies on techniques from linear algebra and contains <xref ref="fields-theorem-finite-extension"/>:
          every finite extension is an algebraic extension.
          This exercise will help you understand this proof.
        </p>

        <p>
          The polynomial <m>r(x)=x^4+2x+2</m> is irreducible over the rationals (Eisenstein's criterion with prime <m>p=2</m>).
          Create a number field that contains a root of <m>r(x)</m>.
          By <xref ref="fields-theorem-finite-extension"/>,
          and the remark following,
          every element of this finite field extension is an algebraic number,
          and hence satisfies some polynomial over the base field (it is this polynomial that Sage will produce with the <c>.minpoly()</c> method).
          This exercise will show how we can use just linear algebra to determine this minimal polynomial.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose that <c>a</c> is the generator of the number field you just created with <m>r(x)</m>.
          Then we will determine the minimal polynomial of <c>t = 3a + 1</c> using just linear algebra.
          According to the proof, the first five powers of <c>t</c>
          (start counting from zero)
          will be linearly dependent. (Why?) So a nontrivial relation of linear dependence on these powers will provide the coefficients of a polynomial with <c>t</c> as a root.
          Compute these five powers,
          then construct the correct linear system to determine the coefficients of the minimal polynomial,
          solve the system, and suitably interpret its solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hints: The <c>vector()</c> and <c>matrix()</c> commands will create vectors and matrices,
          and the <c>.solve_right()</c> method for matrices can be used to find solutions.
          Given an element of the number field,
          which will necessarily be a polynomial in the generator <c>a</c>,
          the <c>.vector()</c> method of the element will provide the coefficients of this polynomial in a list.

          Construct the splitting field of

      <statement>
        <p>
          Form the number field, <m>K</m>,
          which contains a root of the irreducible polynomial <m>q(x)=x^3+3x^2+3x-2</m>.
          Name your root <c>a</c>.
          Verify that <m>q(x)</m> factors,
          but does not split, over <m>K</m>.
          With <m>K</m> now as the base field,
          form an extension of <m>K</m> where the quadratic factor of <m>q(x)</m> has a root.
          Name this root <c>b</c>,
          and call this second extension of the tower <m>L</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use <c>M.&lt;c&gt; = L.absolute_field()</c> to form the flattened tower that is the absolute number field <c>M</c>.
          Find the defining polynomial of <c>M</c> with the <c>.polynomial()</c> method.
          From this polynomial, which must have the generator <c>c</c> as a root,
          you should be able to use elementary algebra to write the generator as a fairly simple expression.
        </p>

        <p>
          <m>M</m> should be the splitting field of <m>q(x)</m>.
          To see this, start over,
          and build from scratch a new number field, <m>P</m>,
          using the simple expression for <c>c</c> that you just found.
          Use <c>d</c> as the name of the root used to construct <c>P</c>.
          Since <c>d</c> is a root of the simple minimal polynomial for <c>c</c>,
          you should be able to write an expression for <c>d</c> that a pre-calculus student would recognize.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now factor the original polynomial <m>q(x)</m>
          (with rational coefficients)
          over <m>P</m>, to see the polynomial split
          (as expected).
          Using this factorization,
          and your simple expression for <c>d</c> write simplified expressions for the three roots of <m>q(x)</m>.
          See if you can convert between the two versions of the roots <q>by hand</q>,
          and without using the isomorphisms provided by the <c>.structure()</c> method on <c>M</c>.
