  <title>Isomorphisms</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Many groups may appear to be different at first glance,
      but can be shown to be the same by a simple renaming of the group elements.
      For example,
      <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> and the subgroup of the circle group
      <m>{\mathbb T}</m> generated by <m>i</m> can be shown to be the same by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two groups and between the group operations.
      In such a case we say that the groups are isomorphic.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Two groups <m>(G, \cdot)</m> and
        <m>(H, \circ)</m> are <term>isomorphic</term><idx><h>Group</h><h>isomorphic</h></idx>
        if there exists a one-to-one and onto map
        <m>\phi : G \rightarrow H</m> such that the group operation is preserved;  that is,
        <me>
          \phi( a \cdot b) = \phi( a) \circ \phi( b)
        </me>
        for all <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>G</m>.
        If <m>G</m> is isomorphic to <m>H</m>,
        we write <m>G \cong H</m>.
        <notation>
          <usage><m>G \cong H</m></usage>
          <description><m>G</m> is isomorphic to a group <m>H</m></description>
        </notation>
        The map <m>\phi</m> is called an <idx><h>Group</h><h>isomorphism of</h></idx><idx><h>Isomorphism</h><h>of groups</h></idx><term>isomorphism</term>.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="isomorph-example-z4">
        <p>
          To show that <m>{\mathbb Z}_4 \cong \langle i \rangle</m>,
          define a map <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z}_4 \rightarrow \langle i \rangle</m> by <m>\phi(n) = i^n</m>.
          We must show that <m>\phi</m> is bijective and preserves the group operation.
          The map <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto because
          <md>
            <mrow>\phi(0) &amp; = 1</mrow>
            <mrow>\phi(1) &amp; = i</mrow>
            <mrow>\phi(2) &amp; = -1</mrow>
            <mrow>\phi(3) &amp; = -i</mrow>
          </md>.
          Since
          <me>
            \phi(m + n) = i^{m+n} = i^m i^n = \phi(m) \phi( n)
          </me>,
          the group operation is preserved.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="isomorph-example-real">
        <p>
          We can define an isomorphism <m>\phi</m> from the additive group of real numbers
          <m>( {\mathbb R}, + )</m> to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers 
          <m>( {\mathbb R^+}, \cdot )</m> with the exponential map; that is,
          <me>
            \phi( x + y) = e^{x + y} = e^x e^y = \phi( x ) \phi( y)
          </me>.
          Of course, we must still show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto,
          but this can be determined using calculus.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="isomorph-example-rational">
        <p>
          The integers are isomorphic to the subgroup of
          <m>{\mathbb Q}^\ast</m> consisting of elements of the form <m>2^n</m>.
          Define a map <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb Q}^\ast</m> by <m>\phi( n ) = 2^n</m>.
          Then
          <me>
            \phi( m + n ) = 2^{m + n} = 2^m 2^n = \phi( m ) \phi( n )
          </me>.
          By definition the map <m>\phi</m> is onto the subset
          <m>\{2^n :n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m> of  <m>{\mathbb Q}^\ast</m>.
          To show that the map is injective,
          assume that <m>m \neq n</m>.
          If we can show that <m>\phi(m) \neq \phi(n)</m>, then we are done.
          Suppose that <m>m \gt n</m> and assume that <m>\phi(m) = \phi(n)</m>.
          Then <m>2^m = 2^n</m> or <m>2^{m - n} = 1</m>,
          which is impossible since <m>m - n \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="isomorph-example-units">
        <p>
          The groups <m>{\mathbb Z}_8</m> and
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m> cannot be isomorphic since they have different orders;
          however, it is true that <m>U(8) \cong U(12)</m>.
          We know that
          <md>
            <mrow>U(8) &amp; = \{1, 3, 5, 7 \}</mrow>
            <mrow>U(12) &amp; = \{1, 5, 7, 11 \}</mrow>
          </md>.
          An isomorphism <m>\phi : U(8) \rightarrow U(12)</m> is then given by
          <md>
            <mrow>1 &amp; \mapsto  1</mrow>
            <mrow>3 &amp; \mapsto  5</mrow>

            <mrow>7 &amp; \mapsto  11</mrow>
          </md>.
          The map <m>\phi</m> is not the only possible isomorphism between these two groups.
          We could define another isomorphism <m>\psi</m> by <m>\psi(1) = 1</m>,
          <m>\psi(3) = 11</m>, <m>\psi(5) = 5</m>, <m>\psi(7) = 7</m>.
          In fact, both of these groups are isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m>
          (see <xref ref="groups-example-z2xz2"/> in <xref ref="groups"/>).
        </p>

      <example xml:id="isomorph-example-not-isomorph">
        <p>
          Even though <m>S_3</m> and
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> possess the same number of elements,
          we would suspect that they are not isomorphic,
          because <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> is abelian and <m>S_3</m> is nonabelian.
          To demonstrate that this is indeed the case,
          suppose that <m>\phi : {\mathbb Z}_6 \rightarrow  S_3</m> is an isomorphism.
          Let <m>a , b \in S_3</m> be two elements such that <m>ab \neq ba</m>.
          Since <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism,
          there exist elements <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> such that
          <me>
            \phi( m ) = a \quad \text{and} \quad \phi( n ) = b
          </me>.
          However,
          <me>
            ab = \phi(m ) \phi(n) = \phi(m + n) = \phi(n + m) = \phi(n ) \phi(m) = ba
          </me>,
          which contradicts the fact that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> do not commute.

            Assertions (1) and (2) follow from the fact that <m>\phi</m> is a bijection.

            Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group with infinite order and suppose that <m>a</m> is a generator of <m>G</m>.

            In this case <m>a^{m - n} = e</m>, where <m>m - n \gt 0</m>,
            which contradicts the fact that <m>a</m> has infinite order.
            Our map is onto since any element in <m>G</m> can be written as <m>a^n</m> for some integer <m>n</m> and <m>\phi(n) = a^n</m>.

        The main goal in group theory is to classify all groups;
        however, it makes sense to consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic.
        We state this result in the following theorem,
        whose proof is left as an exercise.

        Cayley proved that if <m>G</m> is a group,

          <p>
            Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group.
            We must find a group of permutations
            <m>\overline{G}</m> that is isomorphic to <m>G</m>.
            For any <m>g \in G</m>, define a  function
            <m>\lambda_g : G \rightarrow G</m> by <m>\lambda_g(a) = ga</m>.
            We claim that <m>\lambda_g</m> is a permutation of <m>G</m>.
            To show that <m>\lambda_g</m> is one-to-one,
            suppose that <m>\lambda_g(a) = \lambda_g(b)</m>.
            Then
            <me>
              ga =\lambda_g(a) = \lambda_g(b) = gb
            </me>.
            Hence, <m>a = b</m>.
            To show that <m>\lambda_g</m> is onto,
            we must prove that for each <m>a \in G</m>,
            there is a <m>b</m> such that <m>\lambda_g (b) = a</m>.
            Let <m>b = g^{-1} a</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now we are ready to define our group <m>\overline{G}</m>.
            Let

            The group operation is preserved since

        Cayley was educated at Cambridge,
        where he took the first Smith's Prize in mathematics.
        A lawyer for much of his adult life,
        he wrote several papers in his early twenties before entering the legal profession at the age of 25.
        While practicing law he continued his mathematical research,
        writing more than 300 papers during this period of his life.
        These included some of his best work.
        In 1863 he left law to become a professor at Cambridge.
        Cayley wrote more than 900 papers in fields such as group theory,
        geometry, and linear algebra.
        His legal knowledge was very valuable to Cambridge;
        he participated in the writing of many of the university's statutes.
        Cayley was also one of the people responsible for the admission of women to Cambridge.

        Given two groups <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>,
        it is possible to construct a new group from the Cartesian product of <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>,
        <m>G \times H</m>.
        Conversely, given a large group,
        it is sometimes possible to decompose the group;
        that is, a group is sometimes isomorphic to the direct product of two smaller groups.
        Rather than studying a large group <m>G</m>,
        it is often easier to study the component groups of <m>G</m>.

      <title>External Direct Products</title>
      <p>
        If <m>(G,\cdot)</m> and <m>(H, \circ)</m> are groups,
        then we can make the Cartesian product of <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> into a new group.
        As a set, our group is just the ordered pairs
        <m>(g, h) \in G \times H</m> where <m>g \in G</m> and <m>h \in H</m>.
        We can define a binary operation on <m>G \times H</m> by
        <me>
          (g_1, h_1)(g_2, h_2) = (g_1 \cdot g_2, h_1 \circ h_2);
        </me>
        that is, we just multiply elements in the first coordinate as we do in <m>G</m> and elements in the second coordinate as we do in <m>H</m>.
        We have specified the particular operations <m>\cdot</m> and <m>\circ</m> in each group here for the sake of clarity;
        we usually just write <m>(g_1, h_1)(g_2, h_2) = (g_1  g_2, h_1 h_2)</m>.

            Clearly the binary operation defined above is closed.
            If <m>e_G</m> and <m>e_H</m> are the identities of the groups <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> respectively,
            then <m>(e_G, e_H)</m> is the identity of <m>G \times H</m>.
            The inverse of <m>(g, h) \in G \times H</m> is <m>(g^{-1}, h^{-1})</m>.
            The fact that the operation is associative follows directly from the associativity of <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>.

          then one of the subgroups, say <m>H</m>,
          would have to have order <m>3</m>.
          In this case <m>H</m> is the subgroup <m>\{ (1), (123), (132) \}</m>.
          The subgroup <m>K</m> must have order <m>2</m>,
          but no matter which subgroup we choose for <m>K</m>,
          the condition that <m>hk = kh</m> will never be satisfied for <m>h \in H</m> and <m>k \in K</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <theorem xml:id="isomorph-theorem-directproducts">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be the internal direct product of subgroups <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>.
            Then <m>G</m> is isomorphic to <m>H \times K</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>G</m> is an internal direct product,
            we can write any element <m>g \in G</m> as <m>g =hk</m> for some <m>h \in H</m> and some <m>k \in K</m>.
            Define a map <m>\phi : G \rightarrow H \times K</m> by <m>\phi(g) = (h,k)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first problem that we must face is to show that <m>\phi</m> is a well-defined map;
            that is, we must show that <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are uniquely determined by <m>g</m>.
            Suppose that <m>g = hk=h'k'</m>.
            Then <m>h^{-1} h'= k (k')^{-1}</m> is in both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>,
            so it must be the identity.
            Therefore, <m>h = h'</m> and <m>k = k'</m>,
            which proves that <m>\phi</m> is, indeed, well-defined.
          </p>

          <p>
            To show that <m>\phi</m> preserves the group operation,
            let <m>g_1 = h_1 k_1</m> and <m>g_2 = h_2 k_2</m> and observe that
            <md>
              <mrow>\phi( g_1 g_2 ) &amp; = \phi( h_1 k_1 h_2 k_2 )</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = \phi(h_1  h_2 k_1 k_2)</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = (h_1  h_2, k_1 k_2)</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = (h_1, k_1)( h_2, k_2)</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = \phi( g_1 ) \phi(  g_2 )</mrow>
            </md>.
            We will leave the proof that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto as an exercise.
          </p>
        </proof>

      <example xml:id="isomorph-example-z6-product">
        <p>
          The group <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> is an internal direct product isomorphic to <m>\{ 0, 2, 4\} \times \{ 0, 3 \}</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p>
        We can extend the definition of an internal direct product of <m>G</m> to a collection of subgroups
        <m>H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_n</m> of <m>G</m>, by requiring that

        <ul>

            <p>
              <m>G = H_1 H_2 \cdots H_n = \{ h_1 h_2 \cdots h_n : h_i \in H_i \}</m>;

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>H_i \cap \langle \cup_{j \neq i} H_j \rangle = \{ e \}</m>;

              <m>h_i h_j = h_j h_i</m> for all
              <m>h_i \in H_i</m> and <m>h_j \in H_j</m>.
            </p>

            <li>

                Suppose that <m>G</m> does not contain an element of order <m>2p</m> and
                <m>P = \langle z \rangle</m> is a subgroup of order <m>p</m> generated by <m>z</m> and <m>y</m> is an element of order <m>2</m>.
                Prove that the product <m>(z^iy^j)(z^ry^s)</m> can be expressed as a uniquely as <m>z^m y^n</m> for some non negative integers <m>m, n</m>.
                Thus, conclude that there is only one possibility for a non-abelian group of order <m>2p</m>,
                it must therefore be the one we have seen already, the dihedral group.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Sage has limited support for actually creating isomorphisms,
        though it is possible.
        However, there is excellent support for determining if two permutation groups are isomorphic.
        This will allow us to begin a little project to locate <em>all</em>
        of the groups of order less than <m>16</m> in Sage's permutation groups.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection>
      <title>Isomorphism Testing</title>
      <p>
        If <c>G</c> and <c>H</c> are two permutation groups,
        then the command <c>G.is_isomorphic(H)</c> will return <c>True</c> or <c>False</c> as the two groups are,
        or are not,
        isomorphic.
        Since <q>isomorpic to</q> is an equivalence relation by <xref ref="isomorph-theorem-5"/>,
        it does not matter which group plays the role of <c>G</c> and which plays the role of <c>H</c>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we have a few more examples to work with,
        let us introduce the Sage command that creates an external direct product.
        If <c>G</c> and <c>H</c> are two permutation groups,
        then the command <c>direct_product_permgroups([G,H])</c> will return the external direct product as a new permutation group.
        Notice that this is a function
        (not a method)
        and the input is a list.
        Rather than just combining two groups in the list,
        any number of groups can be supplied.
        We illustrate isomorphism testing and direct products in the context of <xref ref="isomorph-theorem-z-pq" />, which is an equivalence,
        so tells us <em>exactly</em> when we have isomorphic groups.
        We use cyclic permutation groups as stand-ins for
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> by <xref ref="isomorph-theorem-3"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, two isomorphic groups.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    m = 12
    n = 7
    gcd(m, n)

                <output>

    G = CyclicPermutationGroup(m)
    H = CyclicPermutationGroup(n)
    dp = direct_product_permgroups([G, H])
    K = CyclicPermutationGroup(m*n)
    K.is_isomorphic(dp)
    </input>
                <output>
    True
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Now, two non-isomorphic groups.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    m = 15
    n = 21
    gcd(m, n)
    </input>
                <output>
    3
    </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
    G = CyclicPermutationGroup(m)
    H = CyclicPermutationGroup(n)
    dp = direct_product_permgroups([G, H])
    K = CyclicPermutationGroup(m*n)
    K.is_isomorphic(dp)
    </input>
                <output>
    False
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Notice how the simple computation of a greatest common divisor predicts the incredibly complicated computation of determining if two groups are isomorphic.
        This is a nice illustration of the power of mathematics,
        replacing a difficult problem
        (group isomorphism)
        by a simple one
        (factoring and divisibility of integers).
        Let us build one more direct product of cyclic groups,
        but with three groups,
        each with orders that are pairwise relatively prime.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you try the following with larger parameters you may get an error
        (<c>database_gap</c>).
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    m = 6
    n = 5
    r = 7
    G = CyclicPermutationGroup(m)
    H = CyclicPermutationGroup(n)
    L = CyclicPermutationGroup(r)
    dp = direct_product_permgroups([G, H, L])
    K = CyclicPermutationGroup(m*n*r)
    K.is_isomorphic(dp)

    <subsection>
      <title>Classifying Finite Groups</title>
      <p>
        Once we understand isomorphic groups as being the <q>same</q>,
        or <q>fundamentally no different,</q>
        or <q>structurally identical,</q>
        then it is natural to ask how many
        <q>really different</q> finite groups there are.
        <xref ref="isomorph-theorem-4"/> gives a partial answer:
        for each prime there is just one finite group,
        with <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> as a concrete manifestation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us embark on a quest to find all the groups of order less than <m>16</m> in Sage as permutation groups.
        For prime orders <m>1,2,3,5,7,11</m> and <m>13</m> we know there is really just one group each,
        and we can realize them all:
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    [CyclicPermutationGroup(p) for p in [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]]
    </input>
                <output>
    [Cyclic group of order 1 as a permutation group,
     Cyclic group of order 2 as a permutation group,
     Cyclic group of order 3 as a permutation group,
     Cyclic group of order 5 as a permutation group,
     Cyclic group of order 7 as a permutation group,
     Cyclic group of order 11 as a permutation group,
     Cyclic group of order 13 as a permutation group]
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        So now our smallest unknown case is order <m>4</m>.
        Sage knows at least three such groups,
        and we can use Sage to check if any pair is isomorphic.
        Notice that since <q>isomorphic to</q>
        is an equivalence relation,
        and hence a transitive relation,
        the two tests below are sufficient.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    G = CyclicPermutationGroup(4)
    H = KleinFourGroup()
    T1 = CyclicPermutationGroup(2)
    T2 = CyclicPermutationGroup(2)
    K = direct_product_permgroups([T1, T2])
    G.is_isomorphic(H)
    </input>
                <output>
    False
    </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
    H.is_isomorphic(K)
    </input>
                <output>
    True
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        So we have at least two different groups:
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
        with the latter also known as the Klein 4-group.
        Sage will not be able to tell us if we have a <em>complete</em>
        list <mdash/> this will always require theoretical results like <xref ref="isomorph-theorem-5"/>.
        We will shortly have a more general result that handles the case of order <m>4</m>,
        but right now, a careful analysis
        (by hand)
        of the possibilities for the Cayley table of a group of order <m>4</m> should lead you to the two possibilities above as the only possibilities.
        Try to deduce what the Cayley table of an order <m>4</m> group should look like,
        since you know about identity elements,
        inverses and cancellation.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have seen at least two groups of order <m>6</m>
        (next on our list of non-prime orders).
        One is abelian and one is not,
        so we do not need Sage to tell us they are structurally different.
        But let us do it anyway.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    G = CyclicPermutationGroup(6)
    H = SymmetricGroup(3)
    G.is_isomorphic(H)
    </input>
                <output>
    False
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Is that all?
        There is <m>{\mathbb Z}_3\times{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
        but that is just <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> since <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> are relatively prime.
        The dihedral group, <m>D_3</m>,
        all symmetries of a triangle,
        is just <m>S_3</m>, the symmetric group on <m>3</m> symbols.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    G = DihedralGroup(3)
    H = SymmetricGroup(3)
    G.is_isomorphic(H)
    </input>
                <output>
    True
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        <xref ref="isomorph-exercise-classify-2p"/> from this section classifies all groups of order <m>2p</m>,
        where <m>p</m> is a prime.
        Such a group is either cyclic or a dihedral group.
        So the two groups above,
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> and <m>D_3</m>,
        are the complete list of groups of order <m>6</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        By this general result, in addition to order <m>6</m>,
        we also know the complete lists of groups of orders <m>10</m> and <m>14</m>.
        To Be Continued.

    <subsection>
      <title>Internal Direct Products</title>
      <p>
        An internal direct product is a statement about subgroups of a single group,
        together with a theorem that links them to an external direct product.
        We will work an example here that will illustrate the nature of an internal direct product.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given an integer <m>n</m>, the set of positive integers less than <m>n</m>,
        and relatively prime to <m>n</m> forms a group under multiplication mod <m>n</m>.
        We will work in the set <c>Integers(n)</c> where we can add <em>and</em> multiply,
        but we want to stay strictly with multiplication only.
      </p>

      <p>
        First we build the subgroup itself.
        Notice how we must convert <c>x</c> into an integer
        (an element of <c>ZZ</c>)
        so that the greatest common divisor computation performs correctly.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    Z36 = Integers(36)
    U = [x for x in Z36 if gcd(ZZ(x), 36) == 1]
    U
    </input>
                <output>
    [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35]
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        So we have a group of order <m>12</m>.
        We are going to try to find a subgroup of order <m>6</m> and a subgroup of order <m>2</m> to form the internal direct product,
        and we will restrict our search initially to cyclic subgroups of order <m>6</m>.
        Sage has a method that will give the order of each of these elements,
        relative to multiplication, so let us examine those next.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    [x.multiplicative_order() for x in U]
    </input>
                <output>
    [1, 6, 6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 6, 3, 6, 6, 2]
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        We have many choices for generators of a cyclic subgroup of order <m>6</m> and for a cyclic subgroup of order <m>2</m>.
        Of course, some of the choices for a generator of the subgroup of order <m>6</m> will generate the same subgroup.
        Can you tell, just by counting,
        how many subgroups of order <m>6</m> there are?
        We are going to pick the first element of order <m>6</m>,
        and the last element of order <m>2</m>, for no particular reason.
        After your work through this once,
        we encourage you to try other choices to understand why some choices lead to an internal direct product and some do not.
        Notice that we choose the elements from the list <c>U</c> so that they are sure to be elements of <c>Z36</c> and behave properly when multiplied.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    a = U[1]
    A = [a^i for i in srange(6)]
    A
    </input>
                <output>
    [1, 5, 25, 17, 13, 29]
    </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
    b = U[11]
    B = [b^i for i in srange(2)]
    B
    </input>
                <output>
    [1, 35]
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        So <c>A</c> and <c>B</c> are two cyclic subgroups.
        Notice that their intersection is the identity element,
        one of our requirements for an internal direct product.
        So this is a good start.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>[x for x in A if x in B]</input>
                <output>[1]</output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        <c>Z36</c> is an abelian group,
        thus the condition on all products commuting will hold,
        but we illustrate the Sage commands that will check this in a non-abelian situation.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    all([x*y == y*x for x in A for y in B])
    </input>
                <output>
    True
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Finally, we need to check that by forming products with elements from <c>A</c> and <c>B</c> we create the entire group.
        Sorting the resulting list will make a check easier for us visually,
        and is required if we want Sage to do the check.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
    T = sorted([x*y for x in A for y in B])
    T
    </input>
                <output>
    [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35]
    </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
    T == U
    </input>
                <output>
    True
    </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        That's it.
        We now condense all this information into the statement that
        <q><c>U</c> is the internal direct product of <c>A</c> and <c>B</c>.</q>
        By <xref ref="isomorph-theorem-directproducts"/>,
        we see that <c>U</c> is isomorphic to a product of a cyclic group of order <m>6</m> and a cyclic group of order <m>2</m>.
        So in a very real sense,
        <c>U</c> is no more or less complicated than <m>{\mathbb Z}_6\times{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
        which is in turn isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_3\times{\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
        So we totally understand the <q>structure</q> of <c>U</c>.
        For example, we can see that <c>U</c> is not cyclic,
        since when written as a product of cyclic groups,
        the two orders are not relatively prime.
        The final expression of <c>U</c> suggests you could find three cyclic subgroups of <c>U</c>,
        with orders <m>3</m>, <m>2</m> and <m>2</m>,
        so that <c>U</c> is an internal direct product of the three subgroups.

    <exercise number="1" xml:id="isomorph-sage-exercise-cayley">
      <statement>
        <p>
          This exercise is about putting Cayley's Theorem into practice.
          First, read and study the theorem.
          Realize that this result by itself is primarily of theoretical interest,
          but with some more theory we could get into some subtler aspects of this (a subject known as
          <q>representation theory</q>).
        </p>

        <p>
          You should create these representations mostly with pencil-and-paper work,
          using Sage as a fancy calculator and assistant.
          You do not need to include all these computations in your worksheet.
          Build the requested group representations and then include enough verifications in Sage to prove that that your representation correctly represents the group.
        </p>

        <p>
          Begin by building a permutation representation of the quaternions,
          <m>Q</m>.
          There are eight elements in <m>Q</m> (<m>\pm 1, \pm I, \pm J, \pm K</m>),
          so you will be constructing a subgroup of <m>S_8</m>.
          For each <m>g\in Q</m> form the function <m>T_g</m>,
          defined as <m>T_g(x)=xg</m>.
          Notice that this definition is the <q>reverse</q>
          of that given in the text.
          This is because Sage composes permutations left-to-right,
          while your text composes right-to-left.
          To create the permutations <m>T_g</m>,
          the two-line version of writing permutations could be very useful as an intermediate step.
          You will probably want to <q>code</q>
          each element of <m>Q</m> with an integer in <m>\{1,2,\dots,8\}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One such representation is included in Sage as <c>QuaternionGroup()</c> <mdash/> your answer should look very similar,
          but perhaps not identical.
          Do not submit your answer for a representation of the quaternions,
          but I strongly suggest working this particular group representation until you are sure you have it right <mdash/> the problems below might be very difficult otherwise.
          You can use Sage's <c>.is_isomorphic()</c> method to check if your representations are correct.
          However, do not use this as a substitute for the part of each question that asks you to investigate properties of your representation towards this end.

              Build the permutation representation of
              <m>{\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_4</m> described in Cayley's Theorem.
              (Remember that this group is additive,
              while the theorem uses multiplicative notation.)
              Include the representation of <em>each</em>
              of the <m>8</m> elements in your submitted work.
              Then construct the permutation group as a subgroup of a full symmetric group that is generated by exactly two of the eight elements you have already constructed.
              Hint: which two elements of
              <m>{\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_4</m> might you use to generate all of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_4</m>?
              Use commands in Sage to investigate various properties of your permutation group,
              other than just <c>.list()</c>,
              to provide evidence that your subgroup is correct <mdash/> include these in your submitted worksheet.

              Build a permutation representation of <m>U(24)</m>,
              the group of units mod 24.
              Again, list a representation of <em>each</em>
              element in your submitted work.
              Then construct the group as a subgroup of a full symmetric group created with three generators.
              To determine these three generators,
              you will likely need to understand <m>U(24)</m> as an internal direct product.
              Use commands in Sage to investigate various properties of your group,
              other than just <c>.list()</c>,
              to provide evidence that your subgroup is correct <mdash/> include these in your submitted worksheet.

        <p>
          Consider the symmetries of a 10-gon,
          <m>D_{10}</m> in your text, <c>DihedralGroup(10)</c> in Sage.
          Presume that the vertices of the 10-gon have been labeled <m>1</m> through <m>10</m> in order.
          Identify the permutation that is a <m>180</m> degree rotation and use it to generate a subgroup <m>R</m> of order <m>2</m>.
          Then identify the permutation that is a <m>72</m> degree rotation,
          and any one of the ten permutations that are a reflection of the <m>10</m>-gon about a line.
          Use these latter two permutations to generate a subgroup <m>S</m> of order <m>10</m>.
          Use Sage to verify that the full dihedral group is the internal direct product of the subgroups <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> by checking the conditions in the definition of an internal direct product.

        <p>
          We have a theorem which says that if a group is an internal direct product,
          then it is isomorphic to some external direct product.
          Understand that this does not mean that you can use the converse in this problem.
          In other words,
          establishing an isomorphism of <m>G</m> with an external direct product <em>does not prove</em>
          that <m>G</m> is an internal direct product.
