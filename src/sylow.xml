  <title>The Sylow Theorems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We already know that the converse of Lagrange's Theorem is false.
      If <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> divides <m>m</m>,
      then <m>G</m> does not necessarily possess a subgroup of order <m>n</m>.
      For example,
      <m>A_4</m> has order <m>12</m> but does not possess a subgroup of order <m>6</m>.
      However, the Sylow Theorems do provide a partial converse for Lagrange's Theorem<mdash/>in certain cases they guarantee us subgroups of specific orders.
      These theorems yield a powerful set of tools for the classification of all finite nonabelian groups.

    <title>The Sylow Theorems</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        We will use what we have learned about group actions to prove the Sylow Theorems.
        Recall for a moment what it means for <m>G</m> to act on itself by conjugation and how conjugacy classes are distributed in the group according to the class equation,
        discussed in <xref ref="actions"/>.
        A group  <m>G</m> acts on itself by conjugation via the map <m>(g,x) \mapsto gxg^{-1}</m>.
        Let <m>x_1, \ldots,
        x_k</m> be representatives from each  of the distinct conjugacy classes of <m>G</m> that consist of more than one element.
        Then the class equation can be written as
        <me>
          |G| = |Z(G)| + [G: C(x_1) ] + \cdots + [ G: C(x_k)]
        </me>,
        where <m>Z(G) = \{g \in G : gx = xg \text{ for all } x \in G\}</m> is the center of <m>G</m> and 
        <m>C(x_i) = \{ g \in G : g x_i = x_i g \}</m> is the centralizer subgroup of <m>x_i</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We begin our investigation of the Sylow Theorems by examining subgroups of order <m>p</m>,
        where <m>p</m> is prime.
        A group <m>G</m> is a <term><m>p</m>-group</term><idx><h>Group</h><h><m>p</m>-group</h></idx>
        if every element in <m>G</m> has as its order a power of <m>p</m>,
        where <m>p</m> is a prime number.
        A subgroup of a group <m>G</m> is a
        <term><m>p</m>-subgroup</term><idx><h>Subgroup!<m>p</m>-subgroup</h></idx> if it is a <m>p</m>-group.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="sylow-theorem-cauchy">
        <title>Cauchy</title>
        <idx><h>Cauchy's Theorem</h></idx>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>p</m> a prime such that <m>p</m> divides the order of <m>G</m>.
            Then <m>G</m> contains a subgroup of order <m>p</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We will use induction on the order of <m>G</m>.
            If <m>|G|=p</m>,
            then clearly <m>G</m> itself is the required subgroup.
            We now assume that every group of order <m>k</m>,
            where <m>p \leq k \lt n</m> and <m>p</m> divides <m>k</m>,
            has an element of order <m>p</m>.
            Assume that <m>|G|= n</m> and
            <m>p \mid n</m> and consider the class equation of <m>G</m>:
            <me>
              |G| = |Z(G)| + [G: C(x_1) ] + \cdots + [ G: C(x_k)]
            </me>.
            We have two cases.
          </p>
          <case>
            <title>Case 1</title>
            <p>
              Suppose the order of one of the centralizer subgroups,
              <m>C(x_i)</m>,
              is divisible by <m>p</m> for some <m>i</m>, <m>i = 1, \ldots, k</m>.
              In this case, by our induction hypothesis, we are done.
              Since <m>C(x_i)</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>p</m> divides <m>|C(x_i)|</m>,
              <m>C(x_i)</m> must contain an element of order <m>p</m>.
              Hence, <m>G</m> must contain an element of order <m>p</m>.
            </p>
          </case>
          <case>
            <title>Case 2</title>
            <p>
              Suppose the order of no centralizer subgroup is divisible by <m>p</m>.
              Then <m>p</m> divides <m>[G:C(x_i)]</m>,
              the order of each conjugacy class in the class equation;
              hence, <m>p</m> must divide the center of <m>G</m>, <m>Z(G)</m>.
              Since <m>Z(G)</m> is abelian,
              it must have a subgroup of order <m>p</m> by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.
              Therefore, the center of <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>p</m>.
            </p>
          </case>
        </proof>
      </theorem>

      <corollary>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group.
            Then <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group if and only if <m>|G| = p^n</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </corollary>

      <example xml:id="sylow-example-a5-subgroups">
        <p>
          Let us consider the group <m>A_5</m>.
          We know that <m>|A_5| = 60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5</m>.
          By Cauchy's Theorem,
          we are guaranteed that <m>A_5</m> has subgroups of orders <m>2</m>,
          <m>3</m> and <m>5</m>.
          The Sylow Theorems will give us even more information about the possible subgroups of <m>A_5</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p>
        We are now ready to state and prove the first of the Sylow Theorems.
        The proof is very similar to the proof of Cauchy's Theorem.
      </p>

      <theorem>
        <title>First Sylow Theorem</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>p</m> a prime such that <m>p^r</m> divides <m>|G|</m>.
            Then <m>G</m> contains a subgroup of order <m>p^r</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We induct on the order of <m>G</m> once again.
            If <m>|G| = p</m>, then we are done.
            Now suppose that the order of <m>G</m> is <m>n</m> with <m>n \gt p</m> and that the theorem is true for all groups of order less than <m>n</m>,
            where <m>p</m> divides <m>n</m>.
            We shall apply the class equation once again:
            <me>
              |G| = |Z(G)| + [G: C(x_1) ] + \cdots + [ G: C(x_k)]
            </me>.
            First suppose that <m>p</m> does not divide <m>[G:C(x_i)]</m> for some <m>i</m>.
            Then <m>p^r \mid |C(x_i)|</m>,
            since <m>p^r</m> divides <m>|G| = |C(x_i)| \cdot [G:C(x_i)]</m>.
            Now we can apply the induction hypothesis to <m>C(x_i)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hence, we may assume that <m>p</m> divides <m>[G:C(x_i)]</m> for all <m>i</m>.
            Since <m>p</m> divides <m>|G|</m>,
            the class equation says that <m>p</m> must divide <m>|Z(G)|</m>;
            hence, by Cauchy's Theorem,
            <m>Z(G)</m> has an element of order <m>p</m>, say <m>g</m>.
            Let <m>N</m> be the group generated by <m>g</m>.
            Clearly, <m>N</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>Z(G)</m> since <m>Z(G)</m> is abelian;
            therefore, <m>N</m> is normal in <m>G</m> since every element in <m>Z(G)</m> commutes with every element in <m>G</m>.
            Now consider the factor group <m>G/N</m> of order <m>|G|/p</m>.
            By the induction hypothesis,
            <m>G/N</m> contains a subgroup <m>H</m> of order <m>p^{r- 1}</m>.
            The inverse image of <m>H</m> under the canonical homomorphism
            <m>\phi : G \rightarrow G/N</m> is a subgroup of order <m>p^r</m> in <m>G</m>.
          </p>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>P</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of a finite group <m>G</m> and let <m>x</m> have as its order a power of <m>p</m>.
            If <m>x^{-1} P x = P</m>, then <m>x \in P</m>.

            <!-- typo corrected.  Suggested by L. Franklin. -->
            <!-- TWJ - 12/19/2011 -->
        <proof>
          <p>
            Certainly <m>x \in N(P)</m>, and the cyclic subgroup,
            <m>\langle xP \rangle \subset N(P)/P</m>,
            has as its order a power of <m>p</m>.
            By the Correspondence Theorem there exists a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>N(P)</m> containing <m>P</m> such that <m>H/P = \langle xP \rangle</m>.
            Since <m>|H| = |P| \cdot |\langle xP \rangle|</m>,
            the order of <m>H</m> must be a power of <m>p</m>.
            However, <m>P</m> is a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup contained in <m>H</m>.
            Since the order of <m>P</m> is the largest power of <m>p</m> dividing <m>|G|</m>,
            <m>H=P</m>.
            Therefore, <m>H/P</m> is the trivial subgroup and <m>xP = P</m>,
            or <m>x \in P</m>.

      <lemma xml:id="sylow-lemma-distinct-conjugates">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> be subgroups of <m>G</m>.
            The number of distinct <m>H</m>-conjugates of <m>K</m> is <m>[H:N(K) \cap H]</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We define a bijection between the conjugacy classes of <m>K</m> and the right cosets of
            <m>N(K) \cap H</m> by <m>h^{-1}Kh \mapsto (N(K) \cap H)h</m>.
            To show that this map is a bijection,
            let <m>h_1, h_2 \in H</m> and suppose that <m>(N(K) \cap H)h_1 = (N(K) \cap H)h_2</m>.
            Then <m>h_2 h_1^{-1} \in N(K)</m>.
            Therefore, <m>K = h_2 h_1^{-1} K h_1 h_2^{-1}</m> or <m>h_1^{-1} K h_1 = h_2^{-1} K h_2</m>,
            and the map is an injection.
            It is easy to see that this map is surjective;
            hence, we have a one-to-one and onto map between the <m>H</m>-conjugates of <m>K</m> and the right cosets of <m>N(K) \cap H</m> in <m>H</m>.

        <title>Second Sylow Theorem</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>p</m> a prime dividing <m>|G|</m>.
            Then all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups of <m>G</m> are conjugate.
            That is, if <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m> are two Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups,

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup of <m>G</m> and suppose that <m>|G|=p^r m</m> with <m>|P|=p^r</m>.

            </me>
            consist of the distinct conjugates of <m>P</m> in <m>G</m>.
            By <xref ref="sylow-lemma-distinct-conjugates"/>, <m>k = [G: N(P)]</m>.
            Notice that

              |G|= p^r m = |N(P)| \cdot [G: N(P)]= |N(P)| \cdot k
            </me>.
            Since <m>p^r</m> divides <m>|N(P)|</m>,
            <m>p</m> cannot divide <m>k</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given any other Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup <m>Q</m>,
            we must show that <m>Q \in {\mathcal S}</m>.
            Consider the <m>Q</m>-conjugacy classes of each <m>P_i</m>.
            Clearly, these conjugacy classes partition <m>{\mathcal S}</m>.
            The size of the partition containing <m>P_i</m> is
            <m>[Q :N(P_i) \cap Q]</m> by <xref ref="sylow-lemma-distinct-conjugates"/>,
            and Lagrange's Theorem tells us that <m>|Q| = [Q :N(P_i) \cap Q] |N(P_i) \cap Q|</m>.
            Thus, <m>[Q :N(P_i) \cap Q]</m> must be a divisor of <m>|Q|= p^r</m>.
            Hence, the number of conjugates in every equivalence class of the partition is a power of <m>p</m>.
            However, since <m>p</m> does not divide <m>k</m>,
            one of these equivalence classes must contain only a single Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup,
            say <m>P_j</m>.
            In this case, <m>x^{-1} P_j x = P_j</m> for all <m>x \in Q</m>.

            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and let <m>p</m> be a prime dividing the order of <m>G</m>.
            Then the number of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups is congruent to
            <m>1 \pmod{p}</m> and divides <m>|G|</m>.

        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P</m> be a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup acting on the set of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups,
            <me>

            by conjugation.
            From the proof of the Second Sylow Theorem,
            the only <m>P</m>-conjugate of <m>P</m> is itself and the order of the other <m>P</m>-conjugacy classes is a power of <m>p</m>.

            <m>|{\mathcal S}|</m> except the equivalence class  <m>\{ P \}</m>.
            Since <m>|{\mathcal S}|</m> is the sum of positive powers of <m>p</m> and <m>1</m>,
            <m>|{\mathcal S}| \equiv 1 \pmod{p}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>G</m> acts on <m>{\mathcal S}</m> by conjugation.
            Since all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups are conjugate,
            there can be only one orbit under this action.
            For <m>P \in {\mathcal S}</m>,
            <me>
              |{\mathcal S}| = |\text{orbit of }P| = [G : N(P)]
            </me>
            by <xref ref="sylow-lemma-distinct-conjugates"/>.
            But <m>[G : N(P)]</m> is a divisor of <m>|G|</m>;
            consequently,
            the number of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups of a finite group must divide the order of the group.

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p>
        Peter Ludvig Mejdell Sylow<idx><h>Sylow, Ludvig</h></idx>
        was born in 1832 in Christiania, Norway
        (now Oslo).
        After attending Christiania University, Sylow taught high school.
        In 1862 he obtained a temporary appointment at Christiania University.
        Even though his appointment was relatively brief,
        he influenced students such as Sophus Lie<idx><h>Lie, Sophus</h></idx>
        (1842<ndash/>1899).
        Sylow had a chance at a permanent chair in 1869,
        but failed to obtain the appointment.
        In 1872, he published a 10-page paper presenting the theorems that now bear his name.
        Later Lie and Sylow collaborated on a new edition of Abel's works.
        In 1898, a chair at Christiania University was finally created for Sylow through the efforts of his student and colleague Lie.
        Sylow died in 1918.

    <title>Examples and Applications</title>
    <introduction>
      <example xml:id="sylow-example-5-sylow-subgroups" >
        <p>
          Using the Sylow Theorems,
          we can determine that <m>A_5</m> has subgroups of orders <m>2</m>,
          <m>3</m>, <m>4</m>, and <m>5</m>.
          The Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups of <m>A_5</m> have orders <m>3</m>,
          <m>4</m>,
          and <m>5</m>.
          The Third Sylow Theorem tells us exactly how many Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups <m>A_5</m> has.
          Since the number of Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups must divide <m>60</m> and also be congruent to <m>1 \pmod{5}</m>,
          there are either one or six Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups in <m>A_5</m>.
          All Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups are conjugate.
          If there were only a single Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup,
          it would be conjugate to itself;
          that is, it would be a normal subgroup of <m>A_5</m>.
          Since <m>A_5</m> has no normal subgroups, this is impossible;
          hence, we have determined that there are exactly six distinct Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups of <m>A_5</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p>
        The Sylow Theorems allow us to prove many useful results about finite groups.
        By using them,
        we can often conclude a great deal about groups of a particular order if certain hypotheses are satisfied.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="sylow-theorem-pq-cyclic">
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are distinct primes with <m>p \lt q </m>,
            then every group <m>G</m> of order <m>pq</m> has a single subgroup of order <m>q</m> and this subgroup is normal in <m>G</m>.
            Hence, <m>G</m> cannot be simple.
            Furthermore,
            if <m>q \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p}</m>, then <m>G</m> is cyclic.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We know that <m>G</m> contains a subgroup <m>H</m> of order <m>q</m>.
            The number of conjugates of <m>H</m> divides <m>pq</m> and is equal to <m>1 + kq</m> for <m>k = 0, 1, \ldots</m>.
            However, <m>1 + q</m> is already too large to divide the order of the group;
            hence, <m>H</m> can only be conjugate to itself.
            That is, <m>H</m> must be normal in <m>G</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The group <m>G</m> also has a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup,
            say <m>K</m>.
            The number of conjugates of <m>K</m> must divide <m>q</m> and be equal to <m>1 + kp</m> for <m>k = 0, 1, \ldots</m>.
            Since <m>q</m> is prime, either
            <m>1 + kp = q</m> or <m>1 + kp = 1</m>.
            If <m>1 + kp = 1</m>, then <m>K</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.
            In this case,
            we can easily show that <m>G</m> satisfies the criteria,
            given in <xref ref="isomorph"/>,
            for the internal direct product of <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>.
            Since <m>H</m> is isomorphic to
            <m>{\mathbb Z}_q</m> and <m>K</m> is isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m>,
            <m>G \cong {\mathbb Z}_p \times {\mathbb Z}_q \cong {\mathbb Z}_{pq}</m> by <xref ref="isomorph-theorem-z-pq" />.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>

      <example xml:id="example-z15">
        <p>
          Every group of order <m>15</m> is cyclic.
          This is true because <m>15 = 5 \cdot 3</m> and <m>5 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{3}</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-group-99-subgroups">
        <p>
          Let us classify all of the groups of order <m>99 = 3^2 \cdot 11</m> up to isomorphism.
          First we will show that every group <m>G</m> of order <m>99</m> is abelian.
          By the Third Sylow Theorem, there are <m>1 + 3k</m> Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups,
          each of order <m>9</m>, for some <m>k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots</m>.
          Also, <m>1 + 3k</m> must divide <m>11</m>;
          hence, there can only be a single normal Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>.
          Similarly, there are <m>1 +11k</m> Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroups and <m>1 +11k</m> must divide <m>9</m>.
          Consequently,
          there is only one Sylow <m>11</m>-subgroup <m>K</m> in <m>G</m>.
          By <xref ref="actions-corollary-p2abelian"/>,
          any group of order <m>p^2</m> is abelian for <m>p</m> prime;
          hence, <m>H</m> is isomorphic either to
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_3 \times {\mathbb Z}_3</m> or to <m>{\mathbb Z}_9</m>.
          Since <m>K</m> has order <m>11</m>,
          it must be isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_{11}</m>.
          Therefore, the only possible groups of order <m>99</m> are
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_3 \times {\mathbb Z}_3 \times {\mathbb Z}_{11}</m> or <m>{\mathbb Z}_9 \times {\mathbb Z}_{11}</m> up to isomorphism.

      <p>
        To determine all of the groups of order <m>5 \cdot 7 \cdot 47 = 1645</m>,
        we need the following theorem.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="sylow-theorem-commutator-subgroup-theorem">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>G' = \langle a b a^{-1} b^{-1} : a, b \in G \rangle</m> be the subgroup consisting of all finite products of elements of the form <m>aba^{-1}b^{-1}</m> in a group <m>G</m>.
            Then <m>G'</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>G/G'</m> is abelian.

      </theorem>

      <p>
        The subgroup <m>G'</m> of <m>G</m> is called the
        <term>commutator subgroup</term><idx><h>Subgroup</h><h>commutator</h></idx> of <m>G</m>.
        We leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise (<xref ref="normal-exercise-commutator"/> in <xref ref="normal"/>).
      </p>

      <example xml:id="sylow-example-sylow-group-1645-subgroups">
        <p>
          We will now show that every group of order <m>5 \cdot 7 \cdot 47 = 1645</m> is abelian,
          and cyclic by <xref ref="isomorph-theorem-z-pq" />.
          By the Third Sylow Theorem,
          <m>G</m> has only one subgroup <m>H_1</m> of order <m>47</m>.
          So <m>G/H_1</m> has order 35 and must be abelian by <xref ref="sylow-theorem-pq-cyclic"/>.
          Hence, the commutator subgroup of <m>G</m> is contained in <m>H</m> which tells us that <m>|G'|</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>47</m>.
          If <m>|G'|=1</m>, we are done.
          Suppose that <m>|G'|=47</m>.
          The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that <m>G</m> has only one subgroup of order <m>5</m> and one subgroup of order <m>7</m>.
          So there exist normal subgroups <m>H_2</m> and <m>H_3</m> in <m>G</m>,
          where <m>|H_2| = 5</m> and <m>|H_3| = 7</m>.
          In either case the quotient group is abelian;
          hence, <m>G'</m> must be a subgroup of <m>H_i</m>, <m>i= 1, 2</m>.
          Therefore, the order of <m>G'</m> is <m>1</m>, <m>5</m>,
          or <m>7</m>.
          However, we already have determined that <m>|G'| =1</m> or <m>47</m>.
          So the commutator subgroup of <m>G</m> is trivial,
          and consequently <m>G</m> is abelian.

      <title>Finite Simple Groups</title>
      <p>
        Given a finite group,
        one can ask whether or not that group has any normal subgroups.
        Recall that a simple group is one with no proper nontrivial normal subgroups.
        As in the case of <m>A_5</m>,
        proving a group to be simple can be a very difficult task;
        however, the Sylow Theorems are useful tools for proving that a group is not simple.
        Usually, some sort of counting argument is involved.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="sylow-example-group-20-not-simple">
        <p>
          Let us show that no group <m>G</m> of order <m>20</m> can be simple.
          By the Third Sylow Theorem,
          <m>G</m> contains one or more Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups.
          The number of such subgroups is congruent to
          <m>1 \pmod{5}</m> and must also divide <m>20</m>.
          The only possible such number is <m>1</m>.
          Since there is only a single Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup and all Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups are conjugate,
          this subgroup must be normal.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="sylow-example-group-pn">
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of order <m>p^n</m>,
          <m>n \gt 1</m> and <m>p</m> prime.
          By <xref ref="actions-theorem-pn"/>, <m>G</m> has a nontrivial center.
          Since the center of any group <m>G</m> is a normal subgroup,
          <m>G</m> cannot be a simple group.
          Therefore, groups of orders <m>4</m>,
          <m>8</m>, <m>9</m>, <m>16</m>,
          <m>25</m>, <m>27</m>, <m>32</m>,
          <m>49</m>, <m>64</m>, and <m>81</m> are not simple.
          In fact, the groups of order <m>4</m>, <m>9</m>, <m>25</m>,
          and <m>49</m> are abelian by <xref ref="actions-corollary-p2abelian"/>.

      <example xml:id="sylow-example-group-56">
        <p>
          No group of order <m>56= 2^3 \cdot 7</m> is simple.
          We have seen that if we can show that there is only one Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup for some prime <m>p</m> dividing 56,
          then this must be a normal subgroup and we are done.
          By the Third Sylow Theorem,
          there are either one or eight Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroups.
          If there is only a single Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroup, then it must be normal.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand,
          suppose that there are eight Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroups.
          Then each of these subgroups must be cyclic;
          hence, the intersection of any two of these subgroups contains only the identity of the group.
          This leaves <m>8 \cdot 6 = 48</m> distinct elements in the group,
          each of order <m>7</m>.
          Now let us count Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups.
          There are either one or seven Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups.
          Any element of a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup other than the identity must have as its order a power of <m>2</m>;
          and therefore cannot be one of the <m>48</m> elements of order <m>7</m> in the Sylow <m>7</m>-subgroups.
          Since a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup has order <m>8</m>,
          there is only enough room for a single Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup in a group of order <m>56</m>.
          If there is only one Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup, it must be normal.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p>
        For other groups <m>G</m>,
        it is more difficult to prove that <m>G</m> is not simple.
        Suppose <m>G</m> has order <m>48</m>.
        In this case the technique that we employed in the last example will not work.
        We need the following lemma to prove that no group of order <m>48</m> is simple.

            Recall that
            <me>
              HK = \{ hk : h \in H, k \in K \}
            </me>.
            Certainly, <m>|HK| \leq |H| \cdot |K|</m> since some element in <m>HK</m> could be written as the product of different elements in <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>.
            It is quite possible that <m>h_1 k_1 = h_2 k_2</m> for
            <m>h_1, h_2 \in H</m> and <m>k_1, k_2 \in K</m>.
            If this is the case, let
            <me>
              a = (h_1)^{-1} h_2 = k_1 (k_2)^{-1}
            </me>.
            Notice that <m>a \in H \cap K</m>,
            since <m>(h_1)^{-1} h_2</m> is in <m>H</m> and
            <m>k_2 (k_1)^{-1}</m> is in <m>K</m>; consequently,

            <m>k = b k_1</m> for <m>b \in H \cap K</m>.
            Then <m>h k = h_1 k_1</m>, where <m>h \in H</m> and <m>k \in K</m>.
            Hence, any element <m>hk \in HK</m> can be written in the form <m>h_i k_i</m> for

            as many times as there are elements in <m>H \cap K</m>;
            that is, <m>|H \cap K|</m> times.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Every finite simple group of nonprime order must be of even order.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <p>
        The proof of this theorem laid the groundwork for a program in the 1960s and 1970s that classified all finite simple groups.
        The success of this program is one of the outstanding achievements of modern mathematics.

          Sage will compute a single Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup for each prime divisor <m>p</m> of the order of the group.
          Then, with conjugacy,
          all of the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups can be enumerated.
          It is also possible to compute the normalizer of a subgroup.

        <p>
          Since <m>|G| = 96 = 2^5 \cdot 3</m>,
          <m>G</m> has either one or three Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups by the Third Sylow Theorem.
          If there is only one subgroup, we are done.
          If there are three Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups,
          let <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> be two of them.

    <title>A Project</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The main objective of finite group theory is to classify all possible finite groups up to isomorphism.
        This problem is very difficult even if we try to classify the groups of order less than or equal to <m>60</m>.
        However, we can break the problem down into several intermediate problems.
        This is a challenging project that requires a working knowledge of the group theory you have learned up to this point.
        Even if you do not complete it,

    <subsection>
      <title>Sylow Subgroups</title>
      <p>
        The Sage permutation group method <c>.sylow_subgroup(p)</c> will return a single Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup.
        If the prime is not a proper divisor of the group order it returns a subgroup of order <m>p^0</m>,
        in other words, a trivial subgroup.
        So be careful about how you construct your primes.
        Sometimes, you may only want <em>one</em> such Sylow subgroup,
        since any two Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups are conjugate,
        and hence isomorphic (<xref ref="sylow-theorem-second-sylow"/>).
        This also means we can create other Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups by conjugating the one we have.
        The permutation group method <c>.conjugate(g)</c> will conjugate the group by <c>g</c>.
      </p>

      <p>
        With repeated conjugations of a single Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup,
        we will always create duplicate subgroups.
        So we need to use a slightly complicated construction to form a list of just the unique subgroups as the list of conjugates.
        This routine that computes all Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups can be helpful throughout this section.
        It could be made much more efficient by conjugating by just one element per coset of the normalizer,
        but it will be sufficient for our purposes here.
        Be sure to execute the next cell if you are online,
        so the function is defined for use later.

      <p>
        Lets investigate the Sylow subgroups of the dihedral group <m>D_{18}</m>.
        As a group of order <m>36=2^2\cdot 3^2</m>,
        we know by the First Sylow Theorem that there is a Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup of order <m>4</m> and a Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup of order <m>9</m>.
        First for <m>p=2</m>, we obtain one Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroup,
        form all the conjugates, and form a list of non-duplicate subgroups.
        (These commands take a while to execute, so be patient.)

      <p>
        The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that for <m>p=2</m> we would expect <m>1, 3</m> or <m>9</m> Sylow <m>2</m>-subgroups,
        so our computational result of <m>9</m> subgroups is consistent with what the theory predicts.
        Can you visualize each of these subgroups as symmetries of an <m>18</m>-gon?
        Notice that we also have many subgroups of order <m>2</m> inside of these subgroups of order <m>4</m>.

        What does the Third Sylow Theorem predict?
        Just <m>1</m> or <m>4</m> Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups.
        Having found just one subgroup computationally,
        we know that all of the conjugates of the lone Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup are equal.
        In other words,
        the Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup is normal in <m>D_{18}</m>.
        Let us check anyway.

      <p>
        At least one of the subgroups of order <m>3</m> contained in this Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup should be obvious by looking at the orders of the generators,
        and then you may even notice that the generators given could be reduced,
        and one is a power of the other.

        Remember that there are many other subgroups, of other orders.
        For example,
        can you construct a subgroup of order <m>6=2\cdot 3</m> in <m>D_{18}</m>?

      <title>Normalizers</title>
      <p>
        A new command that is relevant to this section is the construction of a normalizer.
        The Sage command <c>G.normalizer(H)</c> will return the subgroup of <c>G</c> containing elements that normalize the subgroup <c>H</c>.
        We illustrate its use with the Sylow subgroups from above.

        The normalizer of a subgroup always contains the whole subgroup,

        We saw earlier Sage's permutation group method <c>.is_simple()</c>.
        <xref ref="sylow-example-group-pn"/> tells us that a group of order <m>64</m> is never simple.
        The dicyclic group <c>DiCyclicGroup(16)</c> is a non-abelian group of <m>64</m>,
        so we can test this method on this group.
        It turns out this group has many normal subgroups <mdash/> the list will always contain the trivial subgroup and the group itself,
        so any number exceeding <m>2</m> indicates a non-trivial normal subgroup.

        Here is a rather interesting group,
        one of the <m>26</m> sporadic simple groups,

        The generators used below come from the representation on 100 points in <acro>GAP</acro> format,

        (as you can esily see),

        We saw this group earlier in the exercises for <xref ref="actions"/> on group actions,

        hence its name.

      <title><acro>GAP</acro> Console and Interface</title>
      <p>
        This concludes our exclusive study of group theory,
        though we will be using groups some in the subsequent sections.
        As we have remarked,
        much of Sage's computation with groups is performed by the open source program,
        <q>Groups, Algorithms,
        and Programming,</q> which is better know as simply <acro>GAP</acro>.
        If after this course you outgrow Sage's support for groups,
        then learning <acro>GAP</acro> would be your next step as a group theorist.
        Every copy of Sage includes a copy of <acro>GAP</acro> and is easy to see which version of <acro>GAP</acro> is included:
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>gap.version()</input>
                <output>'4.12.2'</output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        You can interact with <acro>GAP</acro> in Sage in several ways.
        The most direct is by creating a permutation group via Sage's <c>gap()</c> command.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        G = gap('Group( (1,2,3,4,5,6), (1,3,5) )')
        G
        </input>
                <output>
        Group( [ (1,2,3,4,5,6), (1,3,5) ] )
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Now we can use most any <acro>GAP</acro> command with <c>G</c>,
        via the convention that most <acro>GAP</acro> commands expect a group as the first argument,
        and we instead provide the group by using the object-oriented<c>G.</c> syntax.
        If you consult the <acro>GAP</acro> documentation you will see that <c>Center</c> is a <acro>GAP</acro> command that expects a group as its lone argument,
        and <c>Centralizer</c> is a <acro>GAP</acro> command that expects two arguments <mdash/> a group and then a group element.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        G.Center()
        </input>
                <output>
        Group( [ (1,3,5)(2,4,6) ] )
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        G.Centralizer('(1, 3, 5)')
        </input>
                <output>
        Group( [ (1,3,5), (2,4,6), (1,3,5)(2,4,6) ] )
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        If you use the Sage Notebook interface you can set the first line of a compute cell to <c>%gap</c> and the entire cell will be interpreted as if you were interacting directly with <acro>GAP</acro>.
        This means you would now use <acro>GAP</acro>'s syntax,
        which you can see above is slightly different than Sage's universal syntax.
        You can also use the drop-down box at the top of a worksheet,
        and select <c>gap</c> as the system
        (rather than <c>sage</c>)
        and your whole worksheet will be interpreted as <acro>GAP</acro> commands.
        Here is one simple example,
        which you should be able to evaluate in your current worksheet.
        This particular example will not run properly in a Sage Cell in a web page version of this section.
      </p>

            <sage type="display">
                <input>
        %gap
        G := Group( (1,2,3,4,5,6), (1,3,5) );
        Centralizer(G, (1,3,5));
        </input>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Notice that

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              We do not need to wrap the individual permutations in as many quotation marks as we do in Sage.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Assignment is <c>:=</c> not <c>=</c>.
              If you forget the colon,
              you will get an error message such as <c>Variable: 'G' must have a value</c>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              A line <em>must</em> end with a semi-colon.
              If you forget, several lines will be merged together.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can get help about <acro>GAP</acro> commands with a command such as the following,
        though you will soon see that <acro>GAP</acro> assumes you know a lot more algebra than Sage assumes you know.
      </p>

            <sage doctest="not tested">
                <input>
        print(gap.help('SymmetricGroup', pager=False))
        </input>
            </sage>

      <p>
        In the command-line version of Sage,
        you can also use the <acro>GAP</acro> <q>console.</q> Again,
        you need to use <acro>GAP</acro> syntax,
        and you do not have many of the conveniences of the Sage notebook.
        It is also good to know in advance that <c>quit;</c> is how you can leave the <acro>GAP</acro> console and get back to Sage.
        If you run Sage at the command-line,
        use the command <c>gap_console()</c> to start <acro>GAP</acro> running.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a comfort to know that with Sage you get a complete copy of <acro>GAP</acro>,
        installed and all ready to run.
        However, this is not a tutorial on <acro>GAP</acro>,
        so consult the documentation available at the main <acro>GAP</acro> website:
        <url href="http://www.gap-system.org" visual="/www.gap-system.org">www.gap-system.org</url> to learn how to get the most out of <acro>GAP</acro>.

          It can be proved that <em>any group</em>
          with order <m>72</m> is not a simple group,
          using techniques such as those used in the later examples in this chapter.

          Let <m>G</m> be the dihedral group of order <m>36</m>,

          Let <m>H</m> be the one Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroup.

          First, form a list of the distinct conjugates of <m>K</m> by the elements of <m>H</m>,
          and determine the number of subgroups in this list.
          Compare this with the index given in the statement of the lemma,
          employing a single (long) statement making use of the <c>.order()</c>,

          <xref ref="sylow-example-group-48"/> shows that every group of order <m>48</m> has a normal subgroup.
          The dicyclic groups are an infinite family of non-abelian groups with order <m>4n</m>,
          which includes the quaternions
          (the case of <m>n=2</m>).
          So the permutation group <c>DiCyclicGroup(12)</c> has order 48.
          Use Sage to follow the logic of the proof in <xref ref="sylow-example-group-48"/> and construct a normal subgroup in this group.
          (In other words,
          do not just ask for a list of the normal subgroups from Sage,
          but instead trace through the implications in the example to arrive at a normal subgroup,
          and then check your answer.)

          The proofs of the Second and Third Sylow Theorems
          (<xref ref="sylow-theorem-second-sylow"/>, <xref ref="sylow-theorem-third-sylow"/>)
          employ a group action on sets of Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups, For the Second Theorem,
          the list is proposed as incomplete and is proved to be <em>all</em>
          of the Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups.
          In this exercise we will see how these actions behave,
          and how they are different when we use different groups acting on the same set.
        </p>

        <p>
          Construct the six Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups of the alternating group <m>A_5</m>.
          This will be the set of objects for both of our actions.
          Conjugating one of these Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups by an element of <m>A_5</m> will produce another Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup,
          and so can be used to create a group action.
          For such an action,
          from each group element form a Sage permutation of the subgroups by numbering the six subgroups and using these integers as markers for the subgroups.
          You will find the Python list method <c>.index()</c> very helpful.
          Now use all of these permutations to generate a permutation group (a subgroup of <m>S_6</m>).
          Finally, use permutation group methods for orbits and stabilisers,
          <etc/> to explore the actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the first action, use all of <m>A_5</m> as the group.
          Show that the resulting action is transitive.
          In other words, there is exactly one single orbit.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the second action,
          use just one of the Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups as the group.
          Write the class equation for this action in a format that suggests the
          <q>congruent to <m>1</m> mod <m>p</m></q>
          part of the conclusion of the Third Theorem.
