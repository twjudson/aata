<chapter xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xml:id="struct">
  <title>The Structure of  Groups</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of group theory is to classify all groups up to isomorphism;
      that is, given a particular group,
      we should be able to match it up with a known group via an isomorphism.
      For example,
      we have already proved that any finite cyclic group of order <m>n</m> is isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>;
      hence, we <q>know</q> all finite cyclic groups.
      It is probably not reasonable to expect that we will ever know all groups;
      however, we can often classify certain types of groups or distinguish between groups in special cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this chapter we will characterize all finite abelian groups.
      We shall also investigate groups with sequences of subgroups.
      If a group has a sequence of subgroups, say
      <me>
        G = H_n \supset H_{n - 1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}
      </me>,
      where each subgroup <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m> and each of the factor groups <m>H_{i+1}/H_i</m> is abelian,
      then <m>G</m> is a solvable group.
      In addition to allowing us to distinguish between certain classes of groups,
      solvable groups turn out to be central to the study of solutions to polynomial equations.
    </p>
  </introduction>

    <title>Finite Abelian Groups</title>
    <p>
      In our investigation of cyclic groups we found that every group of prime order was isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m>,
      where <m>p</m> was a prime number.
      We also determined that <m>{\mathbb Z}_{mn} \cong {\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n</m> when <m>\gcd(m, n) =1</m>.
      In fact, much more is true.
      Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order;
      that is, every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the type
      <me>
        {\mathbb Z}_{p_1^{\alpha_1}} \times \cdots \times {\mathbb Z}_{p_n^{\alpha_n}}
      </me>,
      where each <m>p_k</m> is prime
      (not necessarily distinct).
    </p>

    <p>
      First, let us examine a slight generalization of finite abelian groups.
      Suppose that <m>G</m> is a group and let
      <m>\{ g_i\}</m> be a set of elements in <m>G</m>,
      where <m>i</m> is in some index set <m>I</m>
      (not necessarily finite).
      The smallest subgroup of <m>G</m> containing all of the <m>g_i</m>'s is the subgroup of <m>G</m>
      <term>generated</term> by the <m>g_i</m>'s.
      If this subgroup of <m>G</m> is in fact all of <m>G</m>,
      then <m>G</m> is generated by the set <m>\{g_i : i \in I \}</m>.
      In this case the <m>g_i</m>'s are said to be the <term>generators</term><idx><h>Generators for a group</h></idx><idx><h>Group</h><h>generators of</h></idx>
      of <m>G</m>.
      If there is a finite set <m>\{ g_i : i \in I \}</m> that generates <m>G</m>,
      then <m>G</m> is <idx><h>Group</h><h>finitely generated</h></idx><idx><h>Finitely generated group</h></idx><term>finitely generated</term>.   
    </p>

    <example xml:id="struct-example-finite-groups">
      <p>
        Obviously, all finite groups are finitely generated.
        For example,
        the group <m>S_3</m> is generated by the permutations <m>(1 \, 2)</m> and <m>(1 \, 2 \,3)</m>.
        The group <m>{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}_n</m> is an infinite group but is finitely generated by <m>\{ (1,0), (0,1) \}</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="struct-example-infinite-groups">
      <p>
        Not all groups are finitely generated.
        Consider the rational numbers
        <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> under the operation of addition.
        Suppose that <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is finitely generated with generators <m>p_1/q_1, \ldots,
        p_n/q_n</m>,
        where each <m>p_i/q_i</m> is a fraction expressed in its lowest terms.
        Let <m>p</m> be some prime that does not divide any of the denominators <m>q_1, \ldots, q_n</m>.
        We claim that <m>1/p</m> cannot be in the subgroup of
        <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> that is generated by  <m>p_1/q_1, \ldots,
        p_n/q_n</m>,
        since <m>p</m> does not divide the denominator of any element in this subgroup.
        This fact is easy to see since the sum of any two generators is
        <me>
          p_i / q_i + p_j / q_j = (p_i q_j + p_j q_i)/(q_i q_j)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>H</m> be the subgroup of a group <m>G</m> that is generated by <m>\{ g_i \in G : i \in I \}</m>.
          Then <m>h \in H</m> exactly when it is a product of the form
          <me>
            h = g_{i_1}^{\alpha_1} \cdots g_{i_n}^{\alpha_n}
          </me>,
          where the <m>g_{i_k}</m>s are not necessarily distinct.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>K</m> be the set of all products of the form <m>g_{i_1}^{\alpha_1} \cdots g_{i_n}^{\alpha_n}</m>,
          where the <m>g_{i_k}</m>s are not necessarily distinct.
          Certainly <m>K</m> is a subset of <m>H</m>.
          We need only show that <m>K</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          If this is the case, then <m>K=H</m>,
          since <m>H</m> is the smallest subgroup containing all the <m>g_i</m>s.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clearly, the set <m>K</m> is closed under the group operation.
          Since <m>g_i^0 = 1</m>, the identity is in <m>K</m>.
          It remains to show that the inverse of an element 
          <m>g =g_{i_1}^{k_1} \cdots g_{i_n}^{k_n}</m> in <m>K</m> must also be in <m>K</m>.
          However,
          <me>
            g^{-1} = (g_{i_1}^{k_{1}} \cdots g_{i_n}^{k_n})^{-1} = (g_{i_n}^{-k_n} \cdots g_{i_{1}}^{-k_{1}})
          </me>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>

    <p>
      The reason that powers of a fixed <m>g_i</m> may occur several times in the product is that we may have a nonabelian group.
      However, if the group is abelian,
      then the <m>g_i</m>s need occur only once.
      For example, a product such as
      <m>a^{-3} b^5 a^7</m> in an abelian group could always be simplified
      (in this case, to <m>a^4 b^5</m>).

    <p>
      Now let us restrict our attention to finite abelian groups.
      We can express any finite abelian group as a finite direct product of cyclic groups.
      More specifically, letting <m>p</m> be prime,
      we define a group <m>G</m> to be a
      <term><m>p</m>-group</term><idx><h>Group</h><h><m>p</m>-group</h></idx>
      if every element in <m>G</m> has as its order a power of <m>p</m>.
      For example,
      both <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> are <m>2</m>-groups,
      whereas <m>{\mathbb Z}_{27}</m> is a <m>3</m>-group.
      We shall prove the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups which tells us that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic <m>p</m>-groups.

    <p>
      The proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups depends on several lemmas.
    </p>

    <lemma xml:id="struct-lemma-cauchy-finite-abelian">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite abelian group of order <m>n</m>.
          If <m>p</m> is a prime that divides <m>n</m>,
          then <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>p</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          We will prove this lemma by induction.
          If <m>n = 1</m>, then there is nothing to show.
          Now suppose that the lemma is true for all groups of order <m>k</m>,
          where <m>k \lt n</m>.
          Furthermore, let <m>p</m> be a prime that divides <m>n</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If <m>G</m> has no proper nontrivial subgroups,
          then <m>G = \langle a \rangle</m>,
          where <m>a</m> is any element other than the identity.
          By <xref ref="cyclic-exercise-subgroups-exist"/>, the order of <m>G</m> must be prime.
          Since <m>p</m> divides <m>n</m>,
          we know that <m>p = n</m>,
          and <m>G</m> contains <m>p - 1</m> elements of order <m>p</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now suppose that <m>G</m> contains a nontrivial proper subgroup <m>H</m>.
          Then <m>1 \lt |H| \lt n</m>.
          If <m>p \mid |H|</m>,
          then <m>H</m> contains an element of order <m>p</m> by induction and the lemma is true.
          Suppose that <m>p</m> does not divide the order of <m>H</m>.
          Since <m>G</m> is abelian,
          it must be the case that <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>,
          and <m>|G| = |H| \cdot |G/H|</m>.
          Consequently, <m>p</m> must divide <m>|G/H|</m>.
          Since <m>|G/H| \lt |G| = n</m>,
          we know that <m>G/H</m> contains an element <m>aH</m> of order <m>p</m> by the induction hypothesis.
          Thus,
          <me>
            H = (aH)^p = a^pH
          </me>,
          and <m>a^p \in H</m> but <m>a \notin H</m>.
          If <m>|H| = r</m>, then <m>p</m> and <m>r</m> are relatively prime,
          and there exist integers <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> such that <m>sp + tr = 1</m>.
          Furthermore, the order of <m>a^p</m> must divide <m>r</m>,
          and <m>(a^p)^r = (a^r)^p = 1</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We claim that <m>a^r</m> has order <m>p</m>.
          We must show that <m>a^r \neq 1</m>.
          Suppose <m>a^r = 1</m>.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>a &amp; = a^{sp + tr}</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = a^{sp} a^{tr}</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = (a^p)^s (a^r)^t</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = (a^p)^s 1</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = (a^p)^s</mrow>
          </md>.
          Since <m>a^p \in H</m>, it must be the case that
          <m>a= (a^p)^s \in H</m>, which is a contradiction.
          Therefore, <m>a^r \neq 1</m> is an element of order <m>p</m> in <m>G</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>

    <p>
      <xref ref="struct-lemma-cauchy-finite-abelian"/> is a special case of Cauchy's Theorem (<xref ref="sylow-theorem-cauchy"/>),
      which states that if <m>G</m> is a finite group and <m>p</m> a prime such that <m>p</m> divides the order of <m>G</m>,
      then <m>G</m> contains a subgroup of order <m>p</m>.
      We will prove Cauchy's Theorem in <xref ref="sylow"/>.

    <lemma xml:id="struct-lemma-p-group-order">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A finite abelian group is a <m>p</m>-group if and only if its order is a power of <m>p</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          If <m>|G| = p^n</m> then by Lagrange’s theorem,
          then the order of any <m>g \in G</m> must divide <m>p^n</m>,
          and therefore must be a power of <m>p</m>.
          Conversely, if <m>|G|</m> is not a power of <m>p</m>,
          then it has some other prime divisor <m>q</m>,
          so by <xref ref="struct-lemma-cauchy-finite-abelian"/>,
          <m>G</m> has an element of order <m>q</m> and thus is not a <m>p</m>-group.

      <statement>

          Let <m>G</m> be a finite abelian group of order <m>n = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}</m>,
          where where <m>p_1, \ldots, p_k</m> are distinct primes and
          <m>\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_k</m> are positive integers.
          Then <m>G</m> is the internal direct product of subgroups <m>G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_k</m>,
          where <m>G_i</m> is the subgroup of <m>G</m> consisting of all elements of order <m>p_i^r</m>
          for some integer <m>r</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Since <m>G</m> is an abelian group,
          we are guaranteed that <m>G_i</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> for <m>i = 1, \ldots, k</m>.
          Since the identity has order <m>p_i^0 = 1</m>,
          we know that <m>1 \in G_i</m>.
          If <m>g \in G_i</m> has order <m>p_i^r</m>,
          then <m>g^{-1}</m> must also have order <m>p_i^r</m>.
          Finally, if <m>h \in G_i</m> has order <m>p_i^s</m>, then
          <me>
            (gh)^{p_i^t} = g^{p_i^t} h^{p_i^t} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1
          </me>,
          where <m>t</m> is the maximum of <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We must show that
          <me>
            G = G_1 G_2 \cdots  G_k
          </me>
          and <m>G_i \cap G_j = \{1 \}</m> for <m>i \neq j</m>.
          Suppose that <m>g_1 \in G_1</m> is in the subgroup generated by <m>G_2, G_3, \ldots, G_k</m>.
          Then <m>g_1 = g_2 g_3 \cdots g_k</m> for <m>g_i \in G_i</m>.
          Since <m>g_i</m> has order <m>p_i^{\alpha_i}</m>,
          we know that <m>g_i^{p^{\alpha_i}} = 1</m> for <m>i = 2, 3, \ldots, k</m>,
          and <m>g_1^{p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}} = 1</m>.
          Since the order of <m>g_1</m> is a power of <m>p_1</m> and <m>\gcd(p_1, p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}) = 1</m>,
          it must be the case that <m>g_1 = 1</m> and the intersection of <m>G_1</m> with any of the subgroups <m>G_2, G_3, \ldots, G_k</m> is the identity.
          A similar argument shows that <m>G_i \cap G_j = \{1 \}</m> for <m>i \neq j</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, we must show that it possible to write every <m>g \in G</m> as a product
          <m>g_1 \cdots g_k</m>, where <m>g_i \in G_i</m>.
          Since the order of <m>g</m> divides the order of <m>G</m>,
          we know that
          <me>
            |g| = p_1^{\beta_1}  p_2^{\beta_2} \cdots p_k^{\beta_k}
          </me>
          for some integers <m>\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_k</m>.
          Letting <m>a_i = |g| / p_i^{\beta_i}</m>,
          the <m>a_i</m>'s are relatively prime;
          hence, there exist integers
          <m>b_1, \ldots,
          b_k</m> such that <m>a_1 b_1 + \cdots + a_k b_k = 1</m>.
          Consequently,
          <me>
            g = g^{a_1 b_1 + \cdots + a_k b_k} = g^{a_1 b_1} \cdots  g^{a_k b_k}
          </me>.
          Since
          <me>
            g^{(a_i b_i ) p_i^{\beta_i}} = g^{b_i |g|} = e
          </me>,
          it follows that <m>g^{a_i b_i}</m> must be in <m>G_{i}</m>.
          Let <m>g_i = g^{a_i b_i}</m>.
          Then <m>g = g_1 \cdots g_k \in G_1 G_2 \cdots G_k</m>.
          Therefore, <m>G = G_1 G_2 \cdots G_k</m> is an internal direct product of subgroups.

				<p>If <m>|G|= 1</m>, then the theorem is trivial. Suppose that the order of <m>G</m> is greater than 1, say

Since <m>G</m> is an abelian group, we are guaranteed that <m>G_i</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> for <m>i = 1, \ldots, n</m>. We must show that

				for some integers <m>\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n</m>. Letting <m>a_i = |g| / p_i^{\beta_i}</m>, the <m>a_i</m>'s are relatively prime; hence, there exist integers <m>b_1, \ldots, b_n</m> such that <m>a_1 b_1 + \cdots + a_n b_n = 1</m>. Consequently, 
					<me>g = g^{a_1 b_1 + \cdots + a_n b_n} = g^{a_1 b_1} \cdots  g^{a_n b_n}.</me>
				Since
					<me>g^{(a_i b_i ) p_i^{\beta_i}} = g^{b_i |g|} = e,</me>
				it follows that <m>g^{a_i b_i}</m> must be in <m>G_{i}</m>. Let <m>g_i = g^{a_i b_i}</m>. Then <m>g = g_1 \cdots g_n</m> and <m>G_i \cap G_j = \{ e \}</m> for <m>i \neq j</m>.</p>

				The order of <m>g_i h_i^{-1}</m> is a power of <m>p_i</m>; hence, the order of <m>g_1 h_1^{-1} \cdots g_n h_n^{-1}</m> is the least common multiple of the orders of the <m>g_i h_i^{-1}</m>.

		<p>The proof of the Fundamental Theorem relies on the following two lemmas.</p>

		 <lemma>
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>G</m> be a finite abelian group and <m>p</m> a prime such that <m>p</m> divides the order of <m>G</m>. Then <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>p</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>We will use mathematical induction and the fact that if <m>G</m> is a cyclic group and <m>m \mid |G|</m>, then <m>G</m> must have an element of order <m>m</m> (<xref ref="cyclic-exercise-subgroups-exist" /> in <xref ref="cyclic" />).  Suppose that <m>|G| = n</m>.  By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic <xref ref="theorem-fund-theorem-arithmetic" />), we can write
					<me>n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k},</me>
				where <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k</m> are distinct primes.  We will induct on <m>S(n) = e_1 + e_2 + \cdots + e_k</m>.  If <m>S(n) = 1</m>, then the order of <m>G</m> is <m>p</m> and there is nothing to prove.  Now assume that the lemma is true for all groups <m>G'</m>, where <m>S(|G'|) \lt S(n)</m>.  Let <m>a \in G</m> such that <m>|a| \gt 1</m>.  If <m>p \mid |a|</m>, then we are done by the comments above.  If  <m>p \nmid |a|</m>, let <m>H = \langle a \rangle</m>.  Since <m>G</m> is an abelian group, we know that <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, and <m>S(G/H) \lt S(n)</m>. Moreover, <m>p</m> divides <m>|G/H| = |G|/|H|</m>, since <m>p \mid |G|</m> but <m>p \nmid |H|</m>.  By the induction hypothesis there exists an element <m>bH \in G/H</m> of order <m>p</m>.  Suppose that the order of <m>b</m> in <m>G</m> is <m>m</m>.  Then <m>(bH)^m = eH</m> in <m>G/H</m>, and so <m>p</m> must divide <m>m</m>.  Therefore, <m>b^{m/p}</m> is an element of order <m>p</m> in <m>G</m>.</p>

    <lemma xml:id="struct-lemma-struct-finite-abelian">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a finite abelian <m>p</m>-group and suppose that <m>g \in G</m> has maximal order.
          Then <m>G</m> is isomorphic to
          <m>\langle g \rangle \times H</m> for some subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="struct-lemma-p-group-order"/>,
          we may assume that the order of <m>G</m> is <m>p^n</m>.
          We shall induct on <m>n</m>.
          If <m>n= 1</m>,
          then <m>G</m> is cyclic of order <m>p</m> and must be generated by <m>g</m>.
          Suppose now that the statement of the lemma holds for all integers <m>k</m> with
          <m>1 \leq k \lt n</m> and let <m>g</m> be of maximal order in <m>G</m>,
          say <m>|g| = p^{m}</m>.
          Then <m>a^{p^m} = e</m> for all <m>a \in G</m>.
          Now choose <m>h</m> in <m>G</m> such that <m>h \notin \langle g \rangle</m>,
          where <m>h</m> has the smallest possible order.
          Certainly such an <m>h</m> exists;
          otherwise, <m>G = \langle g \rangle</m> and we are done.
          Let <m>H = \langle h \rangle</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We claim that <m>\langle g \rangle \cap H = \{ e \}</m>.
          It suffices to show that <m>|H|=p</m>.
          Since <m>|h^p| = |h| / p</m>,
          the order of <m>h^p</m> is smaller than the order of <m>h</m> and must be in
          <m>\langle g \rangle</m> by the minimality of <m>h</m>;
          that is, <m>h^p = g^r</m> for some number <m>r</m>.
          Hence,
          <me>
            (g^r)^{p^{m - 1}} = (h^p)^{p^{m - 1}} = h^{p^{m}} = e
          </me>,
          and the order of <m>g^r</m> must be less than or equal to <m>p^{m-1}</m>.
          Therefore, <m>g^r</m> cannot generate <m>\langle g \rangle</m>.
          Notice that <m>p</m> must occur as a factor of <m>r</m>,
          say <m>r = ps</m>, and <m>h^p = g^r = g^{ps}</m>.
          Define <m>a</m> to be <m>g^{-s}h</m>.
          Then <m>a</m> cannot be in <m>\langle g \rangle</m>;
          otherwise, <m>h</m> would also have to be in <m>\langle g \rangle</m>.
          Also,
          <me>
            a^p = g^{-sp} h^p = g^{-r} h^p = h^{-p} h^p = e
          </me>.
          We have now formed an element <m>a</m> with order <m>p</m> such that <m>a \notin \langle g \rangle</m>.
          Since <m>h</m> was chosen to have the smallest order of all of the elements that are not in <m>\langle g\rangle</m>,
          <m>|H|  = p</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we will show that the order of <m>gH</m> in the factor group <m>G/H</m> must be the same as the order of <m>g</m> in <m>G</m>.
          If <m>|gH| \lt |g| =  p^m</m>, then
          <me>
            H = (gH)^{p^{m-1}} =  g^{p^{m-1}} H;
          </me>
          hence, <m>g^{p^{m-1}}</m> must be in <m>\langle g \rangle \cap H = \{ e \}</m>,
          which contradicts the fact that the order of <m>g</m> is <m>p^m</m>.
          Therefore, <m>gH</m> must have maximal order in <m>G/H</m>.
          By the Correspondence Theorem and our induction hypothesis,
          <me>
            G/H \cong \langle gH \rangle \times K/H
          </me>
          for some subgroup <m>K</m> of <m>G</m> containing <m>H</m>.
          We claim that <m>\langle g \rangle \cap K = \{ e \}</m>.
          If <m>b \in \langle g \rangle \cap K</m>,
          then <m>bH \in \langle gH \rangle \cap K/H = \{ H \}</m> and <m>b \in \langle g \rangle \cap H = \{ e \}</m>.
          It follows that <m>G = \langle g \rangle K</m> implies that <m>G \cong \langle g \rangle \times K</m>.

      The proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups follows very quickly from <xref ref="struct-lemma-direct-product-p-groups"/> and <xref ref="struct-lemma-struct-finite-abelian"/>. By <xref ref="struct-lemma-direct-product-p-groups"/>, <m>G</m> is a product of <m>p</m>-groups.
      Suppose <m>G</m> is a <m>p</m>-group and let <m>g</m> be an element of maximal order in <m>G</m>.
      If <m>\langle g \rangle = G</m>, then we are done;
      otherwise, <m>G \cong {\mathbb Z}_{|g|} \times H</m> for some subgroup <m>H</m> contained in <m>G</m> by the <xref ref="struct-lemma-struct-finite-abelian"/>.
      Since <m>|H| \lt |G|</m>, we can apply mathematical induction.

        <m>k {\mathbb Z}</m> for some <m>k \in {\mathbb N}</m>.

    <p>
      Although composition series need not be unique as in the case of <m>{\mathbb Z}_{60}</m>,
      it turns out that any two composition series are related.
      The factor groups of the two composition series for
      <m>{\mathbb Z}_{60}</m> are <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
      <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>, <m>{\mathbb Z}_3</m>, and <m>{\mathbb Z}_5</m>;
      that is, the two composition series are isomorphic.
      The Jordan-Hölder Theorem says that this is always the case.

      <title>Jordan-Hölder</title>
      <idx>
      <h>Jordan-Hölder Theorem</h>
      </idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Any two composition series of <m>G</m> are isomorphic.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          We shall employ mathematical induction on the length of the composition series.
          If the length of a composition series is 1, then <m>G</m> must be a simple group.
          In this case any two composition series are isomorphic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose now that the theorem is true for all groups having a composition series of length <m>k</m>,
          where <m>1 \leq k \lt n</m>.
          Let
          <md>
            <mrow>G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}</mrow>
            <mrow>G = K_m \supset K_{m-1} \supset \cdots \supset K_1 \supset K_0 = \{ e \}</mrow>
          </md>
          be two composition series for <m>G</m>.
          We can form two new subnormal series for <m>G</m> since
          <m>H_i \cap K_{m-1}</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1}</m> and
          <m>K_j \cap H_{n-1}</m> is normal in <m>K_{j+1} \cap H_{n-1}</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset H_{n-1} \cap K_{m-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_0 \cap K_{m-1} = \{ e \}</mrow>
            <mrow>G = K_m \supset K_{m-1} \supset K_{m-1} \cap H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset K_0 \cap H_{n-1} = \{ e \}</mrow>
          </md>.
          Since <m>H_i \cap K_{m-1}</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1}</m>,
          the Second Isomorphism Theorem (<xref ref="homomorph-theorem-second-isomorphism"/>) implies that
          <md>
            <mrow>(H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1}) / (H_i \cap K_{m-1}) &amp; =  (H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1}) / (H_i \cap ( H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1} ))</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; \cong  H_i (H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1})/ H_i</mrow>
          </md>,
          where <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_i (H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1})</m>.
          Since <m>\{ H_i \}</m> is a composition series,
          <m>H_{i+1} / H_i</m> must be simple;
          consequently,
          <m>H_i (H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1})/ H_i</m> is either <m>H_{i+1}/H_i</m> or <m>H_i/H_i</m>.
          That is, <m>H_i (H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1})</m> must be either <m>H_i</m> or <m>H_{i+1}</m>.
          Removing any nonproper inclusions from the series
          <me>
            H_{n-1} \supset H_{n-1} \cap K_{m-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_0 \cap K_{m-1} = \{ e \}
          </me>,
          we have a composition series for <m>H_{n-1}</m>.
          Our induction hypothesis says that this series must be equivalent to the composition series
          <me>
            H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}
          </me>.
          Hence, the composition series
          <me>
            G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset H_{n-1} \cap K_{m-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_0 \cap K_{m-1} = \{ e \}
          </me>
          are equivalent.
          If <m>H_{n-1} = K_{m-1}</m>,
          then the composition series <m>\{H_i \}</m> and
          <m>\{ K_j \}</m> are equivalent and we are done;
          otherwise, <m>H_{n-1} K_{m-1}</m>  is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> properly containing <m>H_{n-1}</m>.
          In this case <m>H_{n-1} K_{m-1} = G</m> and we can apply the Second Isomorphism Theorem once again; that is,
          <me>
            K_{m-1} / (K_{m-1} \cap H_{n-1}) \cong (H_{n-1} K_{m-1}) / H_{n-1} = G/H_{n-1}
          </me>.
          Therefore,
          <me>
            G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset H_{n-1} \cap K_{m-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_0 \cap K_{m-1} = \{ e \}
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            G = K_m \supset K_{m-1} \supset K_{m-1} \cap H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset K_0 \cap H_{n-1} = \{ e \}
          </me>
          are equivalent and the proof of the theorem is complete.
        </p>
      </proof>

      A group <m>G</m> is <term>solvable</term><idx><h>Group</h><h>solvable</h></idx>

        Sage is able to create direct products of cyclic groups,
        though they are realized as permutation groups.
        This is a situation that should improve.

  <section xml:id="struct-sage" component="sage-info">
    <title>Sage</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Cyclic groups, and direct products of cyclic groups,
        are implemented in Sage as permutation groups.
        However, these groups quickly become very unwieldly representations and it should be easier to work with finite abelian groups in Sage.
        So we will postpone any specifics for this chapter until that happens.
        However, now that we understand the notion of isomorphic groups and the structure of finite abelian groups,
        we can return to our quest to classify all of the groups with order less than <m>16</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection>
      <title>Classification of Finite Groups</title>
      <p>
        It does not take any sophisticated tools to understand groups of order <m>2p</m>,
        where <m>p</m> is an odd prime.
        There are two possibilities <mdash/> a cyclic group of order <m>2p</m> and the dihedral group of order <m>2p</m> that is the set of symmetries of a regular <m>p</m>-gon.
        The proof requires some close, tight reasoning,
        but the required theorems are generally just concern orders of elements, Lagrange's Theorem and cosets.
        See <xref ref="isomorph-exercise-classify-2p"/>.
        This takes care of orders <m>n=6,\,10,\,14</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For <m>n=9</m>,
        the upcoming <xref ref="actions-corollary-p2abelian"/> will tell us that any group of order <m>p^2</m>
        (where <m>p</m> is a prime)
        is abelian.
        So we know from this section that the only two possibilities are
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_9</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_3\times{\mathbb Z}_3</m>.
        Similarly, the upcoming <xref ref="sylow-theorem-pq-cyclic"/> will tell us that every group of order <m>n=15</m> is abelian.
        Now this leaves just one possibility for this order:
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_3\times{\mathbb Z}_5\cong{\mathbb Z}_{15}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have just two orders left to analyze:
        <m>n=8</m> and <m>n=12</m>.
        The possibilities are groups we already know, with one exception.
        However, the analysis that these are the <em>only</em>
        possibilities is more complicated,
        and will not be pursued now, nor in the next few chapters.
        Notice that <m>n=16</m> is more complicated still,
        with <m>14</m> different possibilities
        (which explains why we stopped here).
      </p>

      <p>
        For <m>n=8</m> there are <m>3</m> abelian groups,
        and the two non-abelian groups are the dihedral group
        (symmetries of a square)
        and the quaternions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For <m>n=12</m> there are <m>2</m> abelian groups,
        and <m>3</m> non-abelian groups.
        We know two of the non-abelian groups as a dihedral group,
        and the alternating group on <m>4</m> symbols
        (which is also the symmetries of a tetrahedron).
        The third non-abelian group is an example of a <q>dicyclic</q> group,
        which is an infinite family of groups,
        each with order divisible by <m>4</m>.
        The order <m>12</m> dicyclic group can also be constructed as a
        <q>semi-direct product</q>
        of two cyclic groups <mdash/> this is a construction worth knowing as you pursue further study of group theory.
        The order <m>8</m> dicyclic group is also the quaternions and more generally,
        the dicyclic groups of order <m>2^k</m>,
        <m>k&gt;2</m> are known as <q>generalized quaternion groups.</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        The following examples will show you how to construct some of these groups,
        while also exercising a few of the commands and allowing us to be more certain the following table is accurate.
