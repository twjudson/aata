  <title>The Structure of  Groups</title>
  <introduction permid="YBb">
    <p permid="PKf">
      The ultimate goal of group theory is to classify all groups up to isomorphism;
      that is, given a particular group,
      we should be able to match it up with a known group via an isomorphism.
      For example,
      we have already proved that any finite cyclic group of order <m>n</m> is isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>;
      hence, we <q>know</q> all finite cyclic groups.
      It is probably not reasonable to expect that we will ever know all groups;
      however, we can often classify certain types of groups or distinguish between groups in special cases.
    </p>

    <p permid="vRo">
      In this chapter we will characterize all finite abelian groups.
      We shall also investigate groups with sequences of subgroups.
      If a group has a sequence of subgroups, say
      <me permid="Dao">
        G = H_n \supset H_{n - 1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}
      </me>,
      where each subgroup <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m> and each of the factor groups <m>H_{i+1}/H_i</m> is abelian,
      then <m>G</m> is a solvable group.
      In addition to allowing us to distinguish between certain classes of groups,
      solvable groups turn out to be central to the study of solutions to polynomial equations.

    <title>Finite Abelian Groups</title>
    <p permid="IPA">
      In our investigation of cyclic groups we found that every group of prime order was isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m>,
      where <m>p</m> was a prime number.
      We also determined that <m>{\mathbb Z}_{mn} \cong {\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n</m> when <m>\gcd(m, n) =1</m>.
      In fact, much more is true.
      Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order;
      that is, every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the type
      <me permid="jhx">
        {\mathbb Z}_{p_1^{\alpha_1}} \times \cdots \times {\mathbb Z}_{p_n^{\alpha_n}}
      </me>,
      where each <m>p_k</m> is prime
      (not necessarily distinct).
    </p>

    <p permid="oWJ">
      First, let us examine a slight generalization of finite abelian groups.
      Suppose that <m>G</m> is a group and let
      <m>\{ g_i\}</m> be a set of elements in <m>G</m>,
      where <m>i</m> is in some index set <m>I</m>
      (not necessarily finite).
      The smallest subgroup of <m>G</m> containing all of the <m>g_i</m>'s is the subgroup of <m>G</m>
      <term>generated</term> by the <m>g_i</m>'s.
      If this subgroup of <m>G</m> is in fact all of <m>G</m>,
      then <m>G</m> is generated by the set <m>\{g_i : i \in I \}</m>.
      In this case the <m>g_i</m>'s are said to be the <term>generators</term>
          <idx><h>Generators for a group</h></idx>
          <idx><h>Group</h><h>generators of</h></idx>
      of <m>G</m>.
      If there is a finite set <m>\{ g_i : i \in I \}</m> that generates <m>G</m>,
      then <m>G</m> is <term>finitely generated</term>.

    <example xml:id="example-finite-groups" permid="jag">
      <p permid="ajk">
        Obviously, all finite groups are finitely generated.
        For example,
        the group <m>S_3</m> is generated by the permutations <m>(12)</m> and <m>(123)</m>.
        The group <m>{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}_n</m> is an infinite group but is finitely generated by <m>\{ (1,0), (0,1) \}</m>.

    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-infinite-groups" permid="Php">
      <p permid="Gqt">
        Not all groups are finitely generated.
        Consider the rational numbers
        <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> under the operation of addition.
        Suppose that <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is finitely generated with generators <m>p_1/q_1, \ldots,
        p_n/q_n</m>,
        where each <m>p_i/q_i</m> is a fraction expressed in its lowest terms.
        Let <m>p</m> be some prime that does not divide any of the denominators <m>q_1, \ldots, q_n</m>.
        We claim that <m>1/p</m> cannot be in the subgroup of
        <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> that is generated by  <m>p_1/q_1, \ldots,
        p_n/q_n</m>,
        since <m>p</m> does not divide the denominator of any element in this subgroup.
        This fact is easy to see since the sum of any two generators is

          Certainly <m>K</m> is a subset of <m>H</m>.
          We need only show that <m>K</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          If this is the case, then <m>K=H</m>,
          since <m>H</m> is the smallest subgroup containing all the <m>g_i</m>s.

        <p permid="vhu">
          Clearly, the set <m>K</m> is closed under the group operation.
          Since <m>g_i^0 = 1</m>, the identity is in <m>K</m>.
          It remains to show that the inverse of an element 
          <m>g =g_{i_1}^{k_1} \cdots g_{i_n}^{k_n}</m> in <m>K</m> must also be in <m>K</m>.

    <p permid="VdS">
      The reason that powers of a fixed <m>g_i</m> may occur several times in the product is that we may have a nonabelian group.
      However, if the group is abelian,
      then the <m>g_i</m>s need occur only once.
      For example, a product such as
      <m>a^{-3} b^5 a^7</m> in an abelian group could always be simplified
      (in this case, to <m>a^4 b^5</m>).

      Now let us restrict our attention to finite abelian groups.
      We can express any finite abelian group as a finite direct product of cyclic groups.
      More specifically, letting <m>p</m> be prime,
      we define a group <m>G</m> to be a

      For example,

      whereas <m>{\mathbb Z}_{27}</m> is a <m>3</m>-group.
      We shall prove the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups which tells us that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic <m>p</m>-groups.

          it must be the case that <m>g_1 = 1</m> and the intersection of <m>G_1</m> with any of the subgroups <m>G_2, G_3, \ldots, G_k</m> is the identity.
          A similar argument shows that <m>G_i \cap G_j = \{1 \}</m> for <m>i \neq j</m>.

Since <m>G</m> is an abelian group, we are guaranteed that <m>G_i</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> for <m>i = 1, \ldots, n</m>. We must show that

				Since

		<p>The proof of the Fundamental Theorem relies on the following two lemmas.</p>

		 <lemma>
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>G</m> be a finite abelian group and <m>p</m> a prime such that <m>p</m> divides the order of <m>G</m>. Then <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>p</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>We will use mathematical induction and the fact that if <m>G</m> is a cyclic group and <m>m \mid |G|</m>, then <m>G</m> must have an element of order <m>m</m> (<xref ref="cyclic-exercise-subgroups-exist" /> in <xref ref="cyclic" />).  Suppose that <m>|G| = n</m>.  By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic <xref ref="theorem-fund-theorem-arithmetic" />), we can write
					<me>n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k},</me>
				where <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k</m> are distinct primes.  We will induct on <m>S(n) = e_1 + e_2 + \cdots + e_k</m>.  If <m>S(n) = 1</m>, then the order of <m>G</m> is <m>p</m> and there is nothing to prove.  Now assume that the lemma is true for all groups <m>G'</m>, where <m>S(|G'|) \lt S(n)</m>.  Let <m>a \in G</m> such that <m>|a| \gt 1</m>.  If <m>p \mid |a|</m>, then we are done by the comments above.  If  <m>p \nmid |a|</m>, let <m>H = \langle a \rangle</m>.  Since <m>G</m> is an abelian group, we know that <m>H</m> is normal in <m>G</m>, and <m>S(G/H) \lt S(n)</m>. Moreover, <m>p</m> divides <m>|G/H| = |G|/|H|</m>, since <m>p \mid |G|</m> but <m>p \nmid |H|</m>.  By the induction hypothesis there exists an element <m>bH \in G/H</m> of order <m>p</m>.  Suppose that the order of <m>b</m> in <m>G</m> is <m>m</m>.  Then <m>(bH)^m = eH</m> in <m>G/H</m>, and so <m>p</m> must divide <m>m</m>.  Therefore, <m>b^{m/p}</m> is an element of order <m>p</m> in <m>G</m>.</p>

          we may assume that the order of <m>G</m> is <m>p^n</m>.
          We shall induct on <m>n</m>.
          If <m>n= 1</m>,
          then <m>G</m> is cyclic of order <m>p</m> and must be generated by <m>g</m>.
          Suppose now that the statement of the lemma holds for all integers <m>k</m> with

          say <m>|g| = p^{m}</m>.
          Then <m>a^{p^m} = e</m> for all <m>a \in G</m>.
          Now choose <m>h</m> in <m>G</m> such that <m>h \notin \langle g \rangle</m>,
          where <m>h</m> has the smallest possible order.
          Certainly such an <m>h</m> exists;
          otherwise, <m>G = \langle g \rangle</m> and we are done.
          Let <m>H = \langle h \rangle</m>.

        <p permid="EBg">
          We claim that <m>\langle g \rangle \cap H = \{ e \}</m>.
          It suffices to show that <m>|H|=p</m>.
          Since <m>|h^p| = |h| / p</m>,
          the order of <m>h^p</m> is smaller than the order of <m>h</m> and must be in

          that is, <m>h^p = g^r</m> for some number <m>r</m>.
          Hence,

          and the order of <m>g^r</m> must be less than or equal to <m>p^{m-1}</m>.
          Therefore, <m>g^r</m> cannot generate <m>\langle g \rangle</m>.
          Notice that <m>p</m> must occur as a factor of <m>r</m>,
          say <m>r = ps</m>, and <m>h^p = g^r = g^{ps}</m>.
          Define <m>a</m> to be <m>g^{-s}h</m>.
          Then <m>a</m> cannot be in <m>\langle g \rangle</m>;
          otherwise, <m>h</m> would also have to be in <m>\langle g \rangle</m>.
          Also,
          <me permid="kWK">
            a^p = g^{-sp} h^p = g^{-r} h^p = h^{-p} h^p = e

          We have now formed an element <m>a</m> with order <m>p</m> such that <m>a \notin \langle g \rangle</m>.
          Since <m>h</m> was chosen to have the smallest order of all of the elements that are not in <m>\langle g\rangle</m>,
          <m>|H|  = p</m>.

        <p permid="kIp">
          Now we will show that the order of <m>gH</m> in the factor group <m>G/H</m> must be the same as the order of <m>g</m> in <m>G</m>.
          If <m>|gH| \lt |g| =  p^m</m>, then

          Therefore, <m>gH</m> must have maximal order in <m>G/H</m>.
          By the Correspondence Theorem and our induction hypothesis,

        this series is automatically a principal series.
        Notice that a composition series need not be unique.
        The series

      Although composition series need not be unique as in the case of <m>{\mathbb Z}_{60}</m>,
      it turns out that any two composition series are related.
      The factor groups of the two composition series for
      <m>{\mathbb Z}_{60}</m> are <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
      <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>, <m>{\mathbb Z}_3</m>, and <m>{\mathbb Z}_5</m>;

          Any two composition series of <m>G</m> are isomorphic.

      <proof permid="kPt">
        <p permid="QPy">
          We shall employ mathematical induction on the length of the composition series.
          If the length of a composition series is 1, then <m>G</m> must be a simple group.

          Suppose now that the theorem is true for all groups having a composition series of length <m>k</m>,
          where <m>1 \leq k \lt n</m>.
          Let
          <md permid="wfJ">
            <mrow>G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}</mrow>

          </md>
          be two composition series for <m>G</m>.
          We can form two new subnormal series for <m>G</m> since
          <m>H_i \cap K_{m-1}</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1}</m> and
          <m>K_j \cap H_{n-1}</m> is normal in <m>K_{j+1} \cap H_{n-1}</m>:

          </md>.
          Since <m>H_i \cap K_{m-1}</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1}</m>,
          the Second Isomorphism Theorem (<xref ref="theorem-second-isomorphism"/>) implies that

          Since <m>\{ H_i \}</m> is a composition series,
          <m>H_{i+1} / H_i</m> must be simple;
          consequently,
          <m>H_i (H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1})/ H_i</m> is either <m>H_{i+1}/H_i</m> or <m>H_i/H_i</m>.
          That is, <m>H_i (H_{i+1} \cap K_{m-1})</m> must be either <m>H_i</m> or <m>H_{i+1}</m>.
          Removing any nonproper inclusions from the series
          <me permid="fhy">
            H_{n-1} \supset H_{n-1} \cap K_{m-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_0 \cap K_{m-1} = \{ e \}
          </me>,
          we have a composition series for <m>H_{n-1}</m>.
          Our induction hypothesis says that this series must be equivalent to the composition series

            H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}
          </me>.
          Hence, the composition series
          <me permid="rvQ">
            G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}

          are equivalent.
          If <m>H_{n-1} = K_{m-1}</m>,
          then the composition series <m>\{H_i \}</m> and
          <m>\{ K_j \}</m> are equivalent and we are done;
          otherwise, <m>H_{n-1} K_{m-1}</m>  is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m> properly containing <m>H_{n-1}</m>.
          In this case <m>H_{n-1} K_{m-1} = G</m> and we can apply the Second Isomorphism Theorem once again; that is,
          <me permid="DKi">
            K_{m-1} / (K_{m-1} \cap H_{n-1}) \cong (H_{n-1} K_{m-1}) / H_{n-1} = G/H_{n-1}
          </me>.
          Therefore,
          <me permid="jRr">
            G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset H_{n-1} \cap K_{m-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_0 \cap K_{m-1} = \{ e \}

            G = K_m \supset K_{m-1} \supset K_{m-1} \cap H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset K_0 \cap H_{n-1} = \{ e \}
          </me>

    <introduction permid="EIk">
      <p permid="bYx">
        Cyclic groups, and direct products of cyclic groups,
        are implemented in Sage as permutation groups.
        However, these groups quickly become very unwieldly representations and it should be easier to work with finite abelian groups in Sage.
        So we will postpone any specifics for this chapter until that happens.
        However, now that we understand the notion of isomorphic groups and the structure of finite abelian groups,
        we can return to our quest to classify all of the groups with order less than <m>16</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection permid="FdJ">
      <title>Classification of Finite Groups</title>
      <p permid="LKg">
        It does not take any sophisticated tools to understand groups of order <m>2p</m>,
        where <m>p</m> is an odd prime.
        There are two possibilities <mdash/> a cyclic group of order <m>2p</m> and the dihedral group of order <m>2p</m> that is the set of symmetries of a regular <m>p</m>-gon.
        The proof requires some close, tight reasoning,
        but the required theorems are generally just concern orders of elements, Lagrange's Theorem and cosets.
        See <xref ref="exercise-classify-2p"/>.
        This takes care of orders <m>n=6,\,10,\,14</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="rRp">
        For <m>n=9</m>,
        the upcoming <xref ref="corollary-p2abelian"/> will tell us that any group of order <m>p^2</m>
        (where <m>p</m> is a prime)
        is abelian.
        So we know from this section that the only two possibilities are
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_9</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_3\times{\mathbb Z}_3</m>.
        Similarly, the upcoming <xref ref="theorem-pq-cyclic"/> will tell us that every group of order <m>n=15</m> is abelian.
        Now this leaves just one possibility for this order:
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_3\times{\mathbb Z}_5\cong{\mathbb Z}_{15}</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="XYy">
        We have just two orders left to analyze:
        <m>n=8</m> and <m>n=12</m>.
        The possibilities are groups we already know, with one exception.
        However, the analysis that these are the <em>only</em>
        possibilities is more complicated,
        and will not be pursued now, nor in the next few chapters.
        Notice that <m>n=16</m> is more complicated still,
        with <m>14</m> different possibilities
        (which explains why we stopped here).
      </p>

      <p permid="EfH">
        For <m>n=8</m> there are <m>3</m> abelian groups,
        and the two non-abelian groups are the dihedral group
        (symmetries of a square)
        and the quaternions.
      </p>

      <p permid="kmQ">
        For <m>n=12</m> there are <m>2</m> abelian groups,
        and <m>3</m> non-abelian groups.
        We know two of the non-abelian groups as a dihedral group,
        and the alternating group on <m>4</m> symbols
        (which is also the symmetries of a tetrahedron).
        The third non-abelian group is an example of a <q>dicyclic</q> group,
        which is an infinite family of groups,
        each with order divisible by <m>4</m>.
        The order <m>12</m> dicyclic group can also be constructed as a
        <q>semi-direct product</q>
        of two cyclic groups <mdash/> this is a construction worth knowing as you pursue further study of group theory.
        The order <m>8</m> dicyclic group is also the quaternions and more generally,
        the dicyclic groups of order <m>2^k</m>,
        <m>k&gt;2</m> are known as <q>generalized quaternion groups.</q>
      </p>

      <p permid="QtZ">
        The following examples will show you how to construct some of these groups,
        while also exercising a few of the commands and allowing us to be more certain the following table is accurate.
