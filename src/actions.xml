	<title>Group Actions</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>Group actions generalize group multiplication.  If <m>G</m> is a group and <m>X</m> is an arbitrary set, a group action of an element <m>g \in G</m> and <m>x \in X</m> is a product, <m>gx</m>,  living in <m>X</m>.  Many problems in algebra may best be attacked via group actions.  For example, the proofs of the Sylow theorems and of Burnside's Counting Theorem are most easily understood when they are formulated in terms of group actions.</p>
	</introduction>

	<section xml:id="section-groups-acting-on-sets">
		<title>Groups Acting on Sets</title>

		<p>Let <m>X</m> be a set and <m>G</m> be a group.  A  <term>(left) action</term><index><main>Group</main><sub>action</sub></index> of <m>G</m> on <m>X</m> is a map <m>G \times X \rightarrow X</m> given by <m>(g,x) \mapsto gx</m>, where
			<ol>

				<li><m>ex = x</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>;</li>

				<li><m>(g_1 g_2)x = g_1(g_2 x)</m> for all <m>x \in X</m> and all <m>g_1, g_2 \in G</m>.</li>
 
			</ol>
		Under these considerations <m>X</m> is called a <term><m>G</m>-set</term><index><main><m>G</m>-set</main></index>.  Notice that we are not requiring <m>X</m> to be related to <m>G</m> in any way.  It is true that every group <m>G</m> acts on every set <m>X</m> by the trivial action <m>(g,x) \mapsto x</m>; however, group actions are more interesting if the set <m>X</m> is somehow related to the group <m>G</m>.</p>

		<example xml:id="example-actions-gl2">
			<p>Let <m>G = GL_2( {\mathbb R} )</m> and <m>X = {\mathbb R}^2</m>. Then <m>G</m> acts on <m>X</m> by left multiplication.  If <m>v \in {\mathbb R}^2</m> and <m>I</m> is the identity matrix, then <m>Iv = v</m>.  If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <m>2 \times 2</m> invertible matrices, then <m>(AB)v = A(Bv)</m> since matrix multiplication is associative.</p>
		</example>

		<example xml:id="example-actions-d4">
			<p>Let <m>G = D_4</m> be the symmetry group of a square.  If <m>X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}</m> is the set of vertices of the square, then we can consider <m>D_4</m> to consist of the following permutations: 
				<me>\{ (1), (13), (24), (1432), (1234), (12)(34), (14)(23), (13)(24) \}.</me>
			The elements of <m>D_4</m> act on <m>X</m> as functions.  The permutation <m>(13)(24)</m> acts on vertex 1 by sending it to vertex 3, on vertex 2 by sending it to vertex 4, and so on.  It is easy to see that the  axioms of a group action are satisfied.</p>
		</example>

		<p>In general, if <m>X</m> is any set and <m>G</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_X</m>, the group of all permutations acting on <m>X</m>, then <m>X</m> is a <m>G</m>-set under the group action 
		<me>(\sigma, x) \mapsto \sigma(x)</me>
		for <m>\sigma \in G</m> and <m>x \in X</m>.</p>
 
		<example xml:id="example-actions-left-mult">
			<p>If we let <m>X = G</m>, then every group <m>G</m> acts on itself by the left regular representation; that is, <m>(g,x) \mapsto \lambda_g(x) = gx</m>,  where  <m>\lambda_g</m> is left multiplication:
				<md>
					<mrow>e \cdot x = \lambda_e x = ex = x</mrow>
					<mrow>(gh) \cdot x = \lambda_{gh}x = \lambda_g \lambda_h x = \lambda_g(hx) = g \cdot ( h \cdot x).</mrow>
				</md>
			If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>, then <m>G</m> is an <m>H</m>-set under left multiplication by elements of <m>H</m>.</p>
		</example>
 
		<example xml:id="example-actions-conjugation">
			<p>Let <m>G</m> be a group and suppose that <m>X=G</m>. If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>, then <m>G</m> is an <m>H</m>-set under <term>conjugation</term><index><main>Conjugation</main></index>; that is, we can define an action of <m>H</m> on <m>G</m>, 
				<me>H \times G \rightarrow G,</me>
			via
				<me>(h,g) \mapsto hgh^{-1}</me>
			for <m>h \in H</m> and <m>g \in G</m>.  Clearly, the first axiom for a group action holds.  Observing that 
				<md>
					<mrow>(h_1 h_2, g) &amp; = h_1 h_2 g (h_1 h_2 )^{-1}</mrow>
					<mrow>&amp; = h_1( h_2 g h_2^{-1}) h_1^{-1}</mrow>
					<mrow> &amp; =  (h_1, (h_2, g) ),</mrow>
				</md>
			we see that the second condition is also satisfied.</p>
		</example>
 
		<example xml:id="example-actions-left-cosets">
			<p>Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>{\mathcal L}_H</m> the set of left cosets of <m>H</m>.  The set <m>{\mathcal L}_H</m> is a <m>G</m>-set under the action
				<me>(g, xH) \mapsto gxH.</me>
			Again, it is easy to see that the first axiom is true. Since <m>(g g')xH = g( g'x H)</m>m>, the second axiom is  also true.</p>
		</example>
 
		<p>If <m>G</m> acts on a set <m>X</m> and <m>x, y \in X</m>, then <m>x</m> is said to be <term><m>G</m>-equivalent</term><index><main><m>G</m>-equivalent</main></index> to <m>y</m> if there exists a <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>gx =y</m>. We  write <m>x \sim_G y</m> or <m>x \sim y</m> if two elements are <m>G</m>-equivalent.</p>

		<proposition>
			<statement>
				<p>Let  <m>X</m> be a <m>G</m>-set. Then <m>G</m>-equivalence is an equivalence relation on <m>X</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>The relation <m>\sim</m> is reflexive since <m>ex = x</m>. Suppose that <m>x \sim y</m> for <m>x, y \in X</m>. Then there exists a <m>g</m> such that <m>gx = y</m>m>. In this case <m>g^{-1}y=x</m>; hence, <m>y \sim x</m>. To show that the relation is transitive, suppose that <m>x \sim y</m> and <m>y \sim z</m>. Then there must exist group elements <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> such that <m>gx = y</m> and <m>hy= z</m>. So <m>z = hy = (hg)x</m>, and  <m>x</m> is equivalent to <m>z</m>.</p>
			</proof>
		</proposition>
 
		<p>If <m>X</m> is a <m>G</m>-set, then each partition of <m>X</m> associated with <m>G</m>-equivalence is called an <term>orbit</term><index><main>Orbit</main></index> of <m>X</m> under <m>G</m>.  We will denote the orbit that contains an element <m>x</m>  of <m>X</m> by <m>{\mathcal O}_x</m>.  <notation><usage>{\mathcal O}_x</usage><description>orbit of <m>x</m></description></notation></p>

		<example xml:id="example-actions-permute">
			<p>Let <m>G</m> be the permutation group defined by

			and <m>X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</m>. Then <m>X</m> is a <m>G</m>-set. The orbits are <m>{\mathcal O}_1 = {\mathcal O}_2 = {\mathcal O}_3 =\{1, 2, 3\}</m> and <m>{\mathcal O}_4 = {\mathcal O}_5 = \{4, 5\}</m>. </p>
		</example>
 
		<p>Now suppose that <m>G</m> is a group acting on a set <m>X</m> and let <m>g</m> be an element of <m>G</m>. The <term>fixed point set</term><index><main>Fixed point set</main></index> of <m>g</m> in <m>X</m>, denoted by <m>X_g</m>, is the set of all <m>x \in X</m> such that <m>gx = x</m>.  <notation><usage>X_g</usage><description>fixed point set of <m>g</m></description></notation> We can also study the group elements <m>g</m> that fix a given <m>x \in X</m>.

			<p>It is important to remember that <m>X_g \subset X</m> and <m>G_x \subset G</m>.</p>

		<theorem xml:id="theorem-orbit">
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>X</m> a finite <m>G</m>-set. If <m>x \in X</m>, then <m>|{\mathcal O}_x| = [G:G_x]</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>We know that  <m>|G|/|G_x|</m> is the number of left cosets of <m>G_x</m> in <m>G</m> by Lagrange's Theorem (Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-lagrange" />). We will define a bijective  map <m>\phi</m> between the orbit <m>{\mathcal O}_x</m> of <m>X</m> and the set of left cosets <m>{\mathcal L}_{G_x}</m> of <m>G_x</m> in <m>G</m>. Let <m>y \in {\mathcal O}_x</m>. Then there exists a <m>g</m> in <m>G</m> such that <m>g x = y</m>. Define <m>\phi</m> by <m>\phi( y ) = g G_x</m>. First we must show that this map is well-defined and does not depend on our selection of <m>g</m>. Suppose that <m>h</m> is another element in <m>G</m> such that <m>hx = y</m>. Then <m>g x = h x</m> or <m>x= g^{-1} h x</m>; hence, <m>g^{-1}h</m> is in the stabilizer subgroup of <m>x</m>. Therefore, <m>h \in g G_x</m> or <m>g G_x = h G_x</m>.  Thus, <m>y</m> gets mapped to the same coset regardless of the choice of the representative from that coset.</p>
 
				<p>To show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one, assume that <m>\phi(x_1) = \phi(x_2)</m>. Then there exist <m>g_1, g_2 \in G</m> such that <m>x_1 = g_1 x</m> and <m>x_2 = g_2 x</m>. Since there exists a <m>g \in G_x</m> such that <m>g_2 = g_1 g</m>, 
					<me>x_2 = g_2 x = g_1 g x = g_1 x = x_1;</me>
				consequently, the map <m>\phi</m> is  one-to-one. Finally, we must show that the map <m>\phi</m> is onto. Let <m>g G_x</m> be a left coset. If <m>g x = y</m>, then <m>\phi(y) = g G_x</m>.</p>

		<example xml:id="example-actions-conjugacy-class-sn">
			<p>For <m>S_n</m> it takes a bit of work to find the conjugacy classes.  We begin with cycles.  Suppose that <m>\sigma = ( a_1, \ldots, a_k)</m> is a cycle and let <m>\tau \in S_n</m>. By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-cycle-length-theorem" />,
				<me>\tau \sigma \tau^{-1} = ( \tau( a_1), \ldots, \tau(a_k)).</me>
			Consequently, any two cycles of the same length are conjugate. Now let <m>\sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \cdots \sigma_r</m> be a cycle decomposition, where the length of each cycle <m>\sigma_i</m> is <m>r_i</m>. Then <m>\sigma</m> is conjugate to every other <m>\tau \in S_n</m> whose cycle decomposition has the same lengths.</p>
 
 			<p>The number of conjugate classes in <m>S_n</m> is the number of ways in which <m>n</m> can be partitioned into sums of positive integers. For example, we can partition the integer 3 into the following three sums:

			<p>Burnside's Counting Theorem offers a method of computing the number of distinguishable ways in which something can be done. In addition to its geometric applications, the theorem has interesting applications to areas in switching theory and chemistry. The proof of Burnside's Counting Theorem depends on the following lemma.</p>
 
			<lemma xml:id="lemma-gset">
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>X</m> be a <m>G</m>-set and suppose that <m>x \sim y</m>. Then <m>G_x</m> is isomorphic to <m>G_y</m>.  In particular, <m>|G_x| = |G_y|</m>.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>G</m> act on <m>X</m> by <m>(g,x) \mapsto g \cdot x</m>. Since <m>x \sim y</m>, there exists a <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>g \cdot x=y</m>. Let <m>a \in G_x</m>. Since

			<title>A Geometric Example</title>
 
			<p>Before we apply Burnside's Theorem to switching-theory problems, let us examine the number of ways in which the vertices of a square can be colored black or white. Notice that we can sometimes obtain equivalent colorings by simply applying a rigid motion to the square. For instance, as we have pointed out, if we color one of the vertices black and the remaining three white, it does not matter which vertex was colored black since a rotation will give an equivalent coloring.</p>
 
			<p>The  symmetry group of a square, <m>D_4</m>, is given by the following permutations: 
				<md>
					<mrow>&amp;(1)    &amp; &amp;(13)     &amp; &amp; (24)     &amp; &amp; (1432)</mrow>
					<mrow>&amp;(1234) &amp; &amp;(12)(34) &amp; &amp; (14)(23) &amp; &amp; (13)(24)</mrow>
				</md>
			The group <m>G</m> acts on the set of vertices <m>\{ 1, 2, 3, 4\}</m> in the usual manner. We can describe the different colorings by mappings from <m>X</m> into <m>Y = \{ B, W \}</m> where <m>B</m> and <m>W</m> represent the colors black and white, respectively. Each map <m>f : X \rightarrow Y</m> describes a way to color the corners of the square. Every <m>\sigma \in D_4</m> induces a permutation <m>\widetilde{ \sigma }</m> of the possible colorings given by <m>\widetilde{\sigma}(f) = f \circ \sigma</m> for <m>f : X \rightarrow Y</m>. For example, suppose that <m>f</m> is defined by 
				<md>
					<mrow>f(1) &amp; =  B</mrow>
					<mrow>f(2) &amp; =  W</mrow>
					<mrow>f(3) &amp; =  W</mrow>
					<mrow>f(4) &amp; =  W</mrow>
				</md>
			and <m>\sigma = (1 2)(3 4)</m>. Then <m>\widetilde{\sigma}(f) = f \circ \sigma</m> sends vertex 2 to <m>B</m> and the remaining vertices to <m>W</m>. The set of all such <m>\widetilde{\sigma}</m> is a permutation group <m>\widetilde{G}</m> on the set of possible colorings. Let <m>\widetilde{X}</m>   denote the set of all possible colorings; that is, <m>\widetilde{X}</m> is the set of all possible maps from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m>.  Now we must compute the number of <m>\widetilde{G}</m>-equivalence classes. 
				<ol>
 
					<li><m>\widetilde{X}_{(1)} = \widetilde{X}</m> since the identity fixes every possible coloring. <m>|\widetilde{X}| = 2^4 =~16</m>.</li>
 
					<li><m>\widetilde{X}_{(1 2 3 4)}</m> consists of all <m>f \in \widetilde{X}</m> such that <m>f</m> is unchanged by the permutation <m>(1 23 4)</m>. In this case <m>f(1) = f(2) = f(3) = f(4)</m>, so that all values of <m>f</m> must be the  same; that is, either <m>f(x)= B</m> or <m>f(x)= W</m> for every vertex <m>x</m> of  the square. So <m>|\widetilde{X}_{(1 2 3 4)}| = 2</m>.</li>

					<li><m>|\widetilde{X}_{(1 4 3 2)}| = 2</m>.</li>

					<li> For <m>\widetilde{X}_{(1 3)(2 4)}</m>, <m>f(1) = f(3)</m> and <m>f(2) = f(4)</m>. Thus, <m>|\widetilde{X}_{(13)(24)}| = 2^2 = 4</m>.</li>
 
					<li> <m>|\widetilde{X}_{(1 2)(3 4)}| = 4</m>.</li>

					<li> <m>|\widetilde{X}_{(1 4)(2 3)}| = 4</m>.</li>
 
					<li>For <m>\widetilde{X}_{(1  3 )}</m>, <m>f(1) = f(3)</m> and the other corners can be of any color; hence, <m>|\widetilde{X}_{(1 3)}| = 2^3 = 8</m>.</li>
 
 					<li> <m>|\widetilde{X}_{(2 4)}| = 8</m>.</li>
 				</ol>
			By Burnside's Theorem, we can conclude that there are exactly
				<me>\frac{1}{8} ( 2^4 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^1  + 2^2 + 2^2 +2^3 + 2^3) = 6</me>
			ways to color the vertices of the square.</p>

Furthermore, if <m>n</m> is the number of cycles in the cycle decomposition of <m>\sigma</m>, then <m>|\widetilde{X}_{\sigma}| = |Y|^n</m>.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>\sigma \in G</m> and <m>f \in  \widetilde{X}</m>. Clearly, <m>f \circ \sigma</m> is also in <m>\widetilde{X}</m>. Suppose that <m>g</m> is another function from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m> such that <m>\widetilde{\sigma}(f) = \widetilde{\sigma}(g)</m>. Then for each <m>x \in X</m>,
						<me>f( \sigma(x )) = \widetilde{\sigma}(f)(x) = \widetilde{\sigma}(g)(x) = g( \sigma(x )).</me>
					Since <m>\sigma</m> is a permutation of <m>X</m>, every element <m>x'</m> in <m>X</m> is the image of some <m>x</m> in <m>X</m> under <m>\sigma</m>; hence, <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> agree on all elements of <m>X</m>. Therefore, <m>f=g</m> and <m>\widetilde{\sigma}</m> is injective.  The map <m>\sigma \mapsto \widetilde{\sigma}</m> is onto, since the two sets are the same size.</p>

					<p>Suppose that <m>\sigma</m> is a permutation of <m>X</m> with cycle decomposition <m>\sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \cdots \sigma_n</m>. Any <m>f</m> in <m>{\widetilde{X}}_{\sigma}</m> must have the same value on each cycle of <m>\sigma</m>. Since there are <m>n</m> cycles and <m>|Y|</m> possible values for each cycle, <m>|{\widetilde{X}}_{\sigma}| = |Y|^n</m>.</p>

			<title>Switching Functions</title>
 
			<p>In switching theory we are concerned with the design of electronic circuits with binary inputs and outputs. The simplest of these circuits is a switching function that has <m>n</m> inputs and a single output (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-switching-n-variables" />). Large electronic circuits can often be  constructed by combining smaller modules of this kind. The inherent problem here is that even for a simple circuit a large number of different switching functions can be constructed.  With only four inputs and a single output, we can construct 65,536 different switching functions. However, we can often replace one switching function with another merely by permuting the input leads to the circuit (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-switching-two-variables" />).</p>

			<p>For three input variables there are <m>2^{2^3} = 256</m> possible switching functions; in the case of four variables there are <m>2^{2^4} =\mbox{65,536}</m>. The number of equivalence classes is too large to reasonably calculate directly. It is necessary to employ  Burnside's Theorem.</p>
 
			<p>Consider a switching function with three possible inputs, <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>. As we have mentioned, two switching functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are equivalent if a permutation of the input variables of <m>f</m> gives <m>g</m>. It is important to notice that a permutation of the switching functions is not simply a permutation of the input values <m>\{a, b, c\}</m>. A switching function is a set of output values for the inputs <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>, so when we consider equivalent switching functions, we are permuting <m>2^3</m> possible outputs, not just three input values. For example, each binary triple <m>(a, b, c)</m> has a specific output associated with it. The  permutation <m>(acb)</m> changes outputs as follows: 
				<md>
					<mrow>(0, 0, 0) &amp; \mapsto  (0, 0, 0)</mrow>
					<mrow>(0, 0, 1) &amp; \mapsto  (0, 1, 0)</mrow>
					<mrow>(0, 1, 0) &amp; \mapsto  (1, 0, 0)</mrow>
					<mrow>&amp; \vdots </mrow>
					<mrow> (1, 1, 0) &amp; \mapsto  (1, 0, 1)</mrow>
					<mrow>(1, 1, 1) &amp; \mapsto  (1, 1, 1).</mrow>
				</md></p>

			<p>Let <m>X</m> be the set of output values for a switching function in <m>n</m> variables. Then <m>|X|=2^n</m>. We can enumerate these values as follows: 
				<md>
					<mrow>(0, \ldots, 0, 1) &amp; \mapsto  0</mrow>
					<mrow>(0, \ldots, 1, 0) &amp; \mapsto  1</mrow>
					<mrow>(0, \ldots, 1, 1) &amp; \mapsto  2</mrow>
					<mrow>&amp; \vdots </mrow>
					<mrow>(1, \ldots, 1, 1) &amp; \mapsto  2^n-1.</mrow>
				</md>
			Now let us consider a circuit with four input variables and a single output. Suppose that we can permute the leads  of any circuit according to the following permutation group: 
				<md>
					<mrow>(a)    \quad (ac)     \quad (bd)     \quad (adcb)</mrow>
					<mrow>(abcd) \quad (ab)(cd) \quad (ad)(bc) \quad (ac)(bd).</mrow>
				</md>
			The permutations of the four possible input variables induce the permutations of the output values in Table<nbsp /><xref ref="table-switching-permutation" />.</p>

 			<p>Hence, there are
				<me> \frac{1}{8} (2^{16} + 2 \cdot 2^{12} + 2 \cdot 2^6 + 3 \cdot 2^{10}) = 9616</me>
			possible switching functions of four variables under this group of permutations. This number will be even smaller if we consider the full symmetric group on four letters.</p>

			<title>Historical Note</title>

			<p>William Burnside<index><main>Burnside, William</main></index> was born in London in 1852. He attended Cambridge University from 1871 to 1875 and won the Smith's Prize in his last year.  After his graduation he lectured at Cambridge.  He was made a member of the Royal Society in 1893. Burnside wrote approximately 150 papers on topics in applied mathematics, differential geometry, and probability, but his most famous contributions were in group theory.  Several of Burnside's conjectures have stimulated research to this day.  One such conjecture was that every group of odd order is solvable; that is, for a group <m>G</m> of odd order, there exists a sequence of subgroups 
<me>G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}</me>
such that <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m> and <m>H_{i+1} / H_i</m> is abelian. This conjecture was finally proven by W. Feit<index><main>Feit, W.</main></index> and J. Thompson<index><main>Thompson, J.</main></index> in 1963. Burnside's  <title>The Theory of Groups of Finite Order</title>, published in 1897, was one of the first books to treat groups in a modern context as opposed to permutation groups. The second edition, published in 1911, is still a classic.</p>
