  <title>Group Actions</title>
  <introduction permid="fFx">
    <p permid="FuR">
      Group actions generalize group multiplication.
      If <m>G</m> is a group and <m>X</m> is an arbitrary set,
      a group action of an element <m>g \in G</m> and <m>x \in X</m> is a product,
      <m>gx</m>, living in <m>X</m>.
      Many problems in algebra are best be attacked via group actions.
      For example,
      the proofs of the Sylow theorems and of Burnside's Counting Theorem are most easily understood when they are formulated in terms of group actions.

      Let <m>X</m> be a set and <m>G</m> be a group.
      A <term>(left) action</term>
          <idx><h>Group</h><h>action</h></idx>
      of <m>G</m> on <m>X</m> is a map
      <m>G \times X \rightarrow X</m> given by <m>(g,x) \mapsto gx</m>, where

      <ol permid="cps">
        <li permid="IwB">
          <p permid="tXx">
            <m>ex = x</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>;

            <m>(g_1 g_2)x = g_1(g_2 x)</m> for all <m>x \in X</m> and all <m>g_1, g_2 \in G</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      Under these considerations <m>X</m> is called a
      <term><m>G</m>-set</term>.
          <idx><h><m>G</m>-set</h></idx>
      Notice that we are not requiring <m>X</m> to be related to <m>G</m> in any way.
      It is true that every group <m>G</m> acts on every set <m>X</m> by the trivial action <m>(g,x) \mapsto x</m>;
      however, group actions are more interesting if the set <m>X</m> is somehow related to the group <m>G</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-gl2" permid="JXt">
      <p permid="rrm">
        Let <m>G = GL_2( {\mathbb R} )</m> and <m>X = {\mathbb R}^2</m>.
        Then <m>G</m> acts on <m>X</m> by left multiplication.
        If <m>v \in {\mathbb R}^2</m> and <m>I</m> is the identity matrix,
        then <m>Iv = v</m>.
        If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <m>2 \times 2</m> invertible matrices,
        then <m>(AB)v = A(Bv)</m> since matrix multiplication is associative.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-d4" permid="qeC">
      <p permid="Xyv">
        Let <m>G = D_4</m> be the symmetry group of a square.
        If <m>X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}</m> is the set of vertices of the square,
        then we can consider <m>D_4</m> to consist of the following permutations:
        <me permid="IDS">
          \{ (1), (13), (24), (1432), (1234), (12)(34), (14)(23), (13)(24) \}
        </me>.
        The elements of <m>D_4</m> act on <m>X</m> as functions.
        The permutation <m>(13)(24)</m> acts on vertex <m>1</m> by sending it to vertex <m>3</m>,
        on vertex <m>2</m> by sending it to vertex <m>4</m>, and so on.
        It is easy to see that the  axioms of a group action are satisfied.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p permid="rFH">
      In general, if <m>X</m> is any set and <m>G</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_X</m>,
      the group of all permutations acting on <m>X</m>,
      then <m>X</m> is a <m>G</m>-set under the group action
      <me permid="oLb">
        (\sigma, x) \mapsto \sigma(x)
      </me>
      for <m>\sigma \in G</m> and <m>x \in X</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-left-mult" permid="WlL">
      <p permid="DFE">
        If we let <m>X = G</m>,
        then every group <m>G</m> acts on itself by the left regular representation;
        that is, <m>(g,x) \mapsto \lambda_g(x) = gx</m>,
        where  <m>\lambda_g</m> is left multiplication:
        <md permid="USk">
          <mrow>e \cdot x = \lambda_e x = ex = x</mrow>
          <mrow>(gh) \cdot x = \lambda_{gh}x = \lambda_g \lambda_h x = \lambda_g(hx) = g \cdot ( h \cdot x)</mrow>
        </md>.
        If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
        then <m>G</m> is an <m>H</m>-set under left multiplication by elements of <m>H</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-conjugation" permid="CsU">
      <p permid="jMN">
        Let <m>G</m> be a group and suppose that <m>X=G</m>.
        If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
        then <m>G</m> is an <m>H</m>-set under <term>conjugation</term>;
            <idx><h>Conjugation</h></idx>
        that is, we can define an action of <m>H</m> on <m>G</m>,
        <me permid="AZt">
          H \times G \rightarrow G
        </me>,
        via
        <me permid="hgC">
          (h,g) \mapsto hgh^{-1}
        </me>
        for <m>h \in H</m> and <m>g \in G</m>.
        Clearly, the first axiom for a group action holds.
        Observing that
        <md permid="NnL">
          <mrow>(h_1 h_2, g) &amp; = h_1 h_2 g (h_1 h_2 )^{-1}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = h_1( h_2 g h_2^{-1}) h_1^{-1}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; =  (h_1, (h_2, g) )</mrow>
        </md>,
        we see that the second condition is also satisfied.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-left-cosets" permid="iAd">
      <p permid="PTW">
        Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> and
        <m>{\mathcal L}_H</m> the set of left cosets of <m>H</m>.
        The set <m>{\mathcal L}_H</m> is a <m>G</m>-set under the action
        <me permid="tuU">
          (g, xH) \mapsto gxH
        </me>.
        Again, it is easy to see that the first axiom is true.
        Since <m>(g g')xH = g( g'x H)</m>,
        the second axiom is  also true.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p permid="XMQ">
      If <m>G</m> acts on a set <m>X</m> and <m>x, y \in X</m>,

      We write <m>x \sim_G y</m> or

          Then <m>G</m>-equivalence is an equivalence relation on <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof permid="Qwz">
        <p permid="QZp">
          The relation <m>\sim</m> is reflexive since <m>ex = x</m>.
          Suppose that <m>x \sim y</m> for <m>x, y \in X</m>.
          Then there exists a <m>g</m> such that <m>gx = y</m>.
          In this case <m>g^{-1}y=x</m>;
          hence, <m>y \sim x</m>.
          To show that the relation is transitive,
          suppose that <m>x \sim y</m> and <m>y \sim z</m>.
          Then there must exist group elements <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> such that <m>gx = y</m> and <m>hy= z</m>.
          So <m>z = hy = (hg)x</m>, and <m>x</m> is equivalent to <m>z</m>.

        For <m>S_n</m> it takes a bit of work to find the conjugacy classes.

        Before we apply Burnside's Theorem to switching-theory problems,
        let us examine the number of ways in which the vertices of a square can be colored black or white.
        Notice that we can sometimes obtain equivalent colorings by simply applying a rigid motion to the square.
        For instance, as we have pointed out,
        if we color one of the vertices black and the remaining three white,
        it does not matter which vertex was colored black since a rotation will give an equivalent coloring.
      </p>

      <p permid="Dkf">
        The  symmetry group of a square,
        <m>D_4</m>, is given by the following permutations:
        <md permid="JnM">
          <mrow>&amp;(1)    &amp; &amp;(13)     &amp; &amp; (24)     &amp; &amp; (1432)</mrow>

        </md>
        The group <m>G</m> acts on the set of vertices <m>\{ 1, 2, 3, 4\}</m> in the usual manner.
        We can describe the different colorings by mappings from <m>X</m> into
        <m>Y = \{ B, W \}</m> where <m>B</m> and <m>W</m> represent the colors black and white,
        respectively.
        Each map <m>f : X \rightarrow Y</m> describes a way to color the corners of the square.
        Every <m>\sigma \in D_4</m> induces a permutation
        <m>\widetilde{ \sigma }</m> of the possible colorings given by
        <m>\widetilde{\sigma}(f) = f \circ \sigma</m> for <m>f : X \rightarrow Y</m>.
        For example, suppose that <m>f</m> is defined by
        <md permid="puV">
          <mrow>f(1) &amp; =  B</mrow>
          <mrow>f(2) &amp; =  W</mrow>

          <mrow>f(4) &amp; =  W</mrow>
        </md>
        and <m>\sigma = (1 2)(3 4)</m>.
        Then <m>\widetilde{\sigma}(f) = f \circ \sigma</m> sends vertex <m>2</m> to <m>B</m> and the remaining vertices to <m>W</m>.
        The set of all such <m>\widetilde{\sigma}</m> is a permutation group
        <m>\widetilde{G}</m> on the set of possible colorings.
        Let <m>\widetilde{X}</m> denote the set of all possible colorings;
        that is, <m>\widetilde{X}</m> is the set of all possible maps from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m>.

      <title>Switching Functions</title>
      <p permid="jro">
        In switching theory we are concerned with the design of electronic circuits with binary inputs and outputs.
        The simplest of these circuits is a switching function that has <m>n</m> inputs and a single output (<xref ref="figure-switching-n-variables"/>).
        Large electronic circuits can often be constructed by combining smaller modules of this kind.
        The inherent problem here is that even for a simple circuit a large number of different switching functions can be constructed.
        With only four inputs and a single output,
        we can construct 65,536 different switching functions.
        However, we can often replace one switching function with another merely by permuting the input leads to the circuit (<xref ref="figure-switching-two-variables"/>).

        The number of equivalence classes is too large to reasonably calculate directly.
        It is necessary to employ Burnside's Theorem.

      <p permid="HTY">
        Consider a switching function with three possible inputs,
        <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>.
        As we have mentioned,
        two switching functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are equivalent if a permutation of the input variables of <m>f</m> gives <m>g</m>.
        It is important to notice that a permutation of the switching functions is not simply a permutation of the input values <m>\{a, b, c\}</m>.
        A switching function is a set of output values for the inputs <m>a</m>,
        <m>b</m>,
        and <m>c</m>,
        so when we consider equivalent switching functions,
        we are permuting <m>2^3</m> possible outputs,
        not just three input values.
        For example, each binary triple
        <m>(a, b, c)</m> has a specific output associated with it.
        The permutation <m>(acb)</m> changes outputs as follows:
        <md permid="NXF">
          <mrow>(0, 0, 0) &amp; \mapsto  (0, 0, 0)</mrow>

      <p permid="obh">
        Let <m>X</m> be the set of output values for a switching function in <m>n</m> variables.

        We can enumerate these values as follows:

          <mrow>(0, \ldots, 0, 1) &amp; \mapsto  0</mrow>
          <mrow>(0, \ldots, 1, 0) &amp; \mapsto  1</mrow>
          <mrow>(0, \ldots, 1, 1) &amp; \mapsto  2</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; \vdots</mrow>
          <mrow>(1, \ldots, 1, 1) &amp; \mapsto  2^n-1</mrow>
        </md>.
        Now let us consider a circuit with four input variables and a single output.
        Suppose that we can permute the leads of any circuit according to the following permutation group:
        <md permid="alX">
          <mrow>(a), \quad (ac), \quad (bd), \quad (adcb),</mrow>

          Sage has many commands related to conjugacy, which is a group action.
          It also has commands for orbits and stabilizers of permutation groups.
          In the supplement,
          we illustrate the automorphism group of a (combinatorial) graph as another example of a group action on the vertex set of the graph.

      <title>Historical Note</title>

        William Burnside
            <idx><h>Burnside, William</h></idx>
        was born in London in 1852.
        He attended Cambridge University from 1871 to 1875 and won the Smith's Prize in his last year.
        After his graduation he lectured at Cambridge.
        He was made a member of the Royal Society in 1893.
        Burnside wrote approximately 150 papers on topics in applied mathematics,
        differential geometry, and probability,
        but his most famous contributions were in group theory.
        Several of Burnside's conjectures have stimulated research to this day.
        One such conjecture was that every group of odd order is solvable;
        that is, for a group <m>G</m> of odd order,
        there exists a sequence of subgroups
        <me permid="mAp">
          G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}
        </me>
        such that <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m> and <m>H_{i+1} / H_i</m> is abelian.
        This conjecture was finally proven by W. Feit
            <idx><h>Feit, W.</h></idx>
        and J. Thompson
            <idx><h>Thompson, J.</h></idx>
        in 1963.
        Burnside's <pubtitle>The Theory of Groups of Finite Order</pubtitle>,
        published in 1897,
        was one of the first books to treat groups in a modern context as opposed to permutation groups.
        The second edition, published in 1911, is still a classic.

        Groups can be realized in many ways,
        such as as sets of permutations, as sets of matrices,
        or as sets of abstract symbols related by certain rules (<q>presentations</q>) and in myriad other ways.
        We have concentrated on permutation groups because of their concrete feel,
        with elements written as functions,
        and because of their thorough implementation in Sage.
        Group actions are of great interest when the set they act on is the group itself,
        and group actions will figure prominently in the proofs of the main results of the next chapter.
        However, any time we have a group action on a set,
        we can view that group as a permutation group on the elements of the set.
        So permutation groups are an area of group theory of independent interest,
        with its own definitions and theorems.
      </p>

      <p permid="KeK">
        We will describe Sage's commands applicable when a group action arises naturally via conjugation,
        and then move into the more general situation in a more general application.
      </p>

    <subsection permid="COt">
      <title>Conjugation as a Group Action</title>
      <p permid="YSj">
        We might think we need to be careful how Sage defines conjugation
        (<m>gxg^{-1}</m> versus <m>g^{-1}xg</m>)
        and the difference between Sage and the text on the order of products.
        However, if you look at the definition of the center and centralizer subgroups you can see that any difference in ordering is irrelevant.
        Here are the group action commands for the particular action that is conjugation of the elements of the group.
      </p>

      <p permid="EZs">
        Sage has a permutation group method <c>.center()</c>which returns the subgroup of fixed points.
        The permutation group method, <c>.centralizer(g)</c>,
        returns a subgroup that is the stabilizer of the group element <c>g</c>.
        Finally, the orbits are given by conjugacy classes,
        but Sage will not flood you with the full conjugacy classes and instead gives back a list of one element per conjugacy class,
        the representatives,
        via the permutation group method <c>.conjugacy_classes_representatives()</c>.
        You can manually reconstruct a conjugacy class from a representative,
        as we do in the example below.
      </p>

      <p permid="lgB">
        Here is an example of the above commands in action.
        Notice that an abelian group would be a bad choice for this example.

        As mentioned,
        group actions can be even more interesting when the set they act on is different from the group itself.
        One class of examples is the group of symmetries of a geometric solid,
        where the objects in the set are the vertices of the object,
        or perhaps some other aspect such as edges, faces or diagonals.
        In this case,
        the group is all those permutations that move the solid but leave it filling the same space before the motion
        (<q>rigid motions</q>).
      </p>

      <p permid="JJl">
        In this section we will examine something very similar.
        A <term>graph</term> is a mathematical object,
        consisting of vertices and edges,
        but the only structure is whether or not any given pair of vertices are joined by an edge or not.
        The group consists of permutations of vertices that preserve the structure, that is,
        permutations of vertices that take edges to edges and non-edges to non-edges.
        It is very similar to a symmetry group,
        but there is no notion of any geometric relationships being preserved.

        Your plot should look like the vertices and edges of a cube,
        but may not quite look regular, which is fine,
        since the geometry is not relevant.
        Vertices are labeled with strings of three binary digits,
        <m>0</m> or <m>1</m>,
        and any two vertices are connected by an edge if their strings differ in exactly one location.
        We might expect the group of symmetries to have order <m>24</m>,
        rather than order <m>48</m>, given its resemblance to a cube
        (in appearance and in name).
        However, when not restricted to rigid motions,
        we have new permutations that preserve edges.
        One in particular is to interchange two <q>opposite faces.</q>
        Locate two <m>4</m>-cycles opposite of each other, listed in the same order:
        <m>000, 010, 110, 100</m> and <m>001, 011, 111, 101</m>.

        and you can check that each appears in one of the six elements of the stabilizer.
        So we can understand a transitive group by considering the smaller stabilizer,
        and in this case we can see that each element of the stabilizer is determined by how it permutes the neighbors of the stabilized vertex.

        Transitive groups are both unusual and important.
        To contrast,
        here is a graph automorphism group that is far from transitive
        (without being trivial).
        A path is a graph that has all of its vertices in a line.
        Run the first compute cell to see a path on <m>11</m> vertices.

        <p permid="GeL">
          This exercise asks you to verify the class equation outside of the usual situation where the group action is conjugation.
          Consider the example of the automorphism group of the path on <m>11</m> vertices.
          First construct the list of orbits.
          From each orbit,
          grab the first element of the orbit as a representative.
          Compute the size of the orbit as the index of the stabilizer of the representative in the group via <xref ref="theorem-orbit"/>.
          (Yes, you could just compute the size of the full orbit,
          but the idea of the exercise is to use more group-theoretic results.)
          Then sum these orbit-sizes,
          which should equal the size of the whole vertex set since the orbits form a partition.

          You might start experimenting by drawing pictures on paper before constructing the graph.
