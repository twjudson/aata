	<title>Lattices and Boolean Algebras</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>The axioms of a ring give structure to the operations of addition and multiplication on a set.  However, we can construct algebraic structures, known as lattices and Boolean algebras, that generalize other types of operations.  For example, the important operations on sets are inclusion, union, and intersection.  Lattices  are generalizations of order relations on algebraic spaces, such as set inclusion in set theory and inequality in the  familiar number systems <m>{\mathbb N}</m>, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>, <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>, and <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.  Boolean algebras generalize the operations of intersection and union. Lattices and Boolean algebras have found applications in logic, circuit theory, and probability.</p>

			<title>Partially Ordered Sets</title>

			<p>We begin by the study of lattices and Boolean algebras by generalizing the idea of inequality. Recall that a <term>relation</term> on a set <m>X</m> is a subset of <m>X \times X</m>.  A relation <m>P</m> on <m>X</m> is called a <term>partial order</term><index><main>Partial order</main></index> of <m>X</m> if it satisfies the following axioms.
				<ol>

					<li>The relation is <term>reflexive</term>: <m>(a, a) \in P</m> for all <m>a \in X</m>.</li>

					<li>The relation is <term>antisymmetric</term>: if <m>(a,b) \in P</m> and <m>(b,a) \in P</m>, then <m>a = b</m>.</li>

					<li>The relation is <term>transitive</term>: if <m>(a, b) \in P</m> and <m>(b, c) \in P</m>, then <m>(a, c) \in P</m>.</li>

				</ol>
			We will usually write <m>a \preceq b</m> to mean <m>(a, b) \in P</m> unless some symbol is naturally associated with a particular partial order, such as <m>a \leq b</m> with integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, or <m>X \subseteq Y</m> with sets <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>. A set <m>X</m> together with a partial order <m>\preceq</m> is called a <term>partially ordered set</term>,<index><main>Partially ordered set</main></index> or <term>poset</term><index><main>Poset</main><sub>definition of</sub></index>. <notation><usage>a \preceq b</usage><description><m>a</m> is less than <m>b</m></description></notation></p>

			<example xml:id="example-boolean-z-less-equal">
				<p>The set of integers (or rationals  or reals) is a poset where <m>a \leq  b</m> has the usual meaning for two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.</p>
			</example>

			<example xml:id="example-boolean-power-set-subset">
				<p>Let <m>X</m> be any set.  We will define the <term>power set</term><index><main>Power set</main></index> of <m>X</m> to be the set of all subsets of <m>X</m>. We denote the power set of <m>X</m> by <m>{\mathcal P}(X)</m>. For example, let <m>X = \{ a, b, c \}</m>.  Then <m>{\mathcal P}(X)</m> is  the set of all subsets of the set  <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m>: 
					<md>

						<mrow>&amp; \{ a, b \} &amp; &amp; \{ a, c\} &amp; &amp;\{ b, c\} &amp; &amp; \{ a, b, c \}. &amp;</mrow>
					</md>
				On any power set of a set <m>X</m>, set inclusion, <m>\subseteq</m>, is a partial order.  We can represent the order on <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m> schematically by a diagram such as the one in  Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-partial-order" />.</p>

			<p>Let <m>Y</m> be a subset of a poset <m>X</m>.

					<p>Let <m>u_1</m> and <m>u_2</m> be least upper bounds for <m>Y</m>. By the definition of the least upper bound, <m>u_1 \preceq u</m> for all upper bounds <m>u</m> of <m>Y</m>.

			<p>In set theory we have certain duality conditions. For example, by De Morgan's laws, any statement about sets that is true about <m>(A \cup B)'</m> must also be true about <m>A' \cap B'</m>. We also have a duality principle for lattices.</p>

							<li>Absorption laws: <m>a \vee (a \wedge b) = a</m> and <m>a \wedge ( a \vee b ) =a</m>.</li>

						</ol></p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>By the Principle of Duality, we need only prove the first statement in each part.</p>

					<p>(1)   By definition <m>a \vee b</m> is the least upper bound of <m>\{ a, b\}</m>, and <m>b \vee a</m> is the least upper bound of <m>\{ b, a \}</m>; however, <m>\{ a, b\}  = \{ b, a \}</m>.</p>
 
					<p>(2) We will show that <m>a \vee ( b \vee c)</m> and <m>(a \vee b) \vee c</m> are both least upper bounds of <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m>. Let <m>d =  a \vee b</m>. Then <m>c \preceq  d \vee c = (a \vee b) \vee c</m>. We also know that 
						<me>a \preceq  a \vee b =d \preceq  d \vee c = (a \vee b) \vee c.</me>
					A similar argument demonstrates that <m>b \preceq (a \vee b) \vee c</m>. Therefore, <m>(a \vee b) \vee c</m> is an upper bound of <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m>. We now need to show that <m>(a \vee b) \vee c</m> is the least upper bound of <m>\{ a, b, c\}</m>. Let <m>u</m> be some other upper bound of <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m>.  Then <m>a \preceq u</m> and <m>b \preceq u</m>; hence, <m>d = a \vee b \preceq u</m>. Since <m>c \preceq u</m>, it follows that <m>(a \vee b) \vee c = d \vee c \preceq u</m>. Therefore, <m>(a \vee b) \vee c</m> must be the least upper  bound of <m>\{ a, b, c\}</m>. The argument that shows  <m>a \vee ( b \vee c)</m>  is the least upper bound of <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m> is the same.  Consequently, <m>a \vee ( b \vee c) = (a \vee b) \vee c</m>.</p>
 
					<p>(3) The join of <m>a</m> and <m>a</m> is the least upper bound of <m>\{ a \}</m>; hence, <m>a \vee a = a</m>.</p>
 
					<p>(4) Let <m>d = a \wedge b</m>. Then <m>a \preceq a \vee d</m>. On the other hand, <m>d = a \wedge b \preceq a</m>, and so <m>a \vee d \preceq a</m>. Therefore, <m>a \vee ( a \wedge b) = a</m>.</p>

			</theorem>
 
			<p>Given any arbitrary set <m>L</m> with operations <m>\vee</m> and <m>\wedge</m>, satisfying the conditions of the previous theorem, it is natural to ask whether or not this set comes from some lattice. The following theorem says that this is always the case.</p>
 
			<theorem xml:id="theorem-partial-order">
				<statement>
					<p> Let <m>L</m> be a nonempty set with two binary operations <m>\vee</m> and <m>\wedge</m> satisfying the commutative, associative, idempotent, and  absorption laws.  We can define a partial order on <m>L</m> by <m>a \preceq b</m> if <m>a \vee b = b</m>. Furthermore, <m>L</m> is a lattice with respect  to <m>\preceq</m> if for all <m>a, b \in L</m>, we define the least upper bound and greatest lower bound of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> by <m>a \vee b</m> and <m>a \wedge b</m>, respectively.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>We first show that <m>L</m> is a poset under <m>\preceq</m>. Since <m>a \vee a = a</m>, <m>a \preceq a</m> and <m>\preceq</m> is reflexive. To show that <m>\preceq</m> is antisymmetric, let <m>a \preceq b</m> and <m>b \preceq a</m>. Then <m>a \vee b = b</m> and <m>b \vee a = a</m>.By the commutative law, <m>b = a \vee b = b \vee a = a</m>.   Finally, we must show that <m>\preceq</m> is transitive. Let <m>a \preceq b</m> and <m>b \preceq c</m>. Then <m>a \vee b = b</m> and <m>b \vee c = c</m>.  Thus,
						<me>a \vee c = a \vee (b \vee c ) = ( a \vee b) \vee c = b \vee c = c,</me>
					or <m>a \preceq c</m>.</p>
 
					<p>To show that <m>L</m> is a lattice, we must prove that <m>a \vee b</m> and <m>a \wedge b</m> are, respectively, the least upper and greatest lower bounds of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. Since <m>a=(a \vee b) \wedge a = a \wedge (a \vee b)</m>, it follows that <m>a \preceq a \vee b</m>.  Similarly, <m>b \preceq a \vee b</m>. Therefore, <m>a \vee b</m> is an upper bound for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. Let <m>u</m> be any other upper bound of both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. Then <m>a \preceq u</m> and <m>b \preceq u</m>. But <m>a \vee b \preceq u</m> since 
						<me>(a \vee b) \vee u = a \vee (b \vee u) = a \vee u = u.</me>
					The proof that <m>a \wedge b</m> is the greatest lower bound of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is left as an exercise.</p>

			<p>Let us investigate the example of the power set, <m>{\mathcal P}(X)</m>, of a set <m>X</m> more  closely. The power set is a lattice that is  ordered by inclusion. By the definition of the power set, the largest element in <m>{\mathcal P}(X)</m> is <m>X</m> itself and the smallest element is <m>\emptyset</m>, the empty set. For any set <m>A</m> in <m>{\mathcal P}(X)</m>, we know that <m>A \cap X = A</m> and <m>A \cup \emptyset = A</m>. This suggests the following definition for lattices.

			We know that <m>A \cup A' = X</m> and <m>A \cap A' = \emptyset</m>. We can generalize this example for lattices.

			<p>A <term>Boolean algebra</term><index><main>Boolean algebra</main><sub>definition of</sub></index> is a lattice <m>B</m> with a greatest element <m>I</m> and a smallest element <m>O</m> such that <m>B</m> is both distributive and complemented. The power set of <m>X</m>, <m>{\mathcal P}(X)</m>, is our prototype for a Boolean algebra.  As it turns out, it is also one of the most important Boolean algebras. The following theorem allows us to characterize Boolean algebras in terms of the binary relations <m>\vee</m> and <m>\wedge</m> without mention of the fact that a Boolean algebra is a poset.</p>

			<theorem>
				<statement>
					<p>A set <m>B</m> is a Boolean algebra if and only if there exist binary operations <m>\vee</m> and <m>\wedge</m> on <m>B</m> satisfying the following axioms.
						<ol>

							<li><m>a \vee b = b \vee a</m> and <m>a \wedge b = b \wedge a</m> for <m>a, b \in B</m>.</li>
	 
							<li><m>a \vee ( b \vee c) = (a \vee b) \vee c</m> and <m>a \wedge ( b \wedge c) = (a \wedge b) \wedge c</m> for <m>a, b, c \in B</m>.</li>

							<li>There exist elements <m>I</m> and <m>O</m> such that <m>a \vee O = a</m> and <m>a \wedge I = a</m> for all <m>a \in B</m>.</li>
	 
							<li>For every <m>a \in B</m> there exists an <m>a' \in B</m> such that <m>a \vee a' = I</m> and <m>a \wedge a' = O</m>.</li>

						</ol></p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>B</m> be a set satisfying (1)<ndash />(5) in the theorem. One of the idempotent laws is satisfied since
						<md>
							<mrow>a &amp; = a \vee O</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; = a \vee (a \wedge a')</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; = (a \vee a) \wedge (a \vee a')</mrow>

							<mrow>&amp; = a \vee a.</mrow>
						</md>
					Observe that 
						<me>I \vee b = (I \vee b ) \wedge I = (I \wedge I) \vee (b \wedge I) = I \vee I =  I.</me>
					Consequently, the first of the two absorption laws holds, since
						<md>
							<mrow>a \vee (a \wedge b) &amp; = (a \wedge I) \vee (a \wedge b)</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; = a \wedge (I \vee b)</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; = a  \wedge I</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; = a.</mrow>
						</md>
					The other idempotent and absorption laws are proven similarly. Since <m>B</m> also satisfies (1)<ndash />(3), the conditions of Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-partial-order" /> are met; therefore, <m>B</m> must be a lattice.  Condition (4) tells us that <m>B</m> is a distributive lattice.</p>
	 
					<p>For <m>a \in B</m>, <m>O \vee a = a</m>; hence, <m>O \preceq a</m> and <m>O</m> is the smallest element in <m>B</m>. To show that <m>I</m> is the largest element in <m>B</m>, we will first show that <m>a \vee b = b</m> is equivalent to <m>a \wedge b = a</m>.  Since <m>a \vee I = a</m> for all <m>a \in B</m>, using the absorption laws we can determine that
						<me>a \vee I =(a \wedge I) \vee I = I \vee ( I \wedge a) = I</me>
					or <m>a \preceq I</m> for all <m>a</m> in <m>B</m>. Finally, since we know that <m>B</m> is complemented by (5), <m>B</m> must be a Boolean algebra.</p>
	 
					<p>Conversely, suppose that <m>B</m> is a Boolean algebra. Let <m>I</m> and <m>O</m> be the greatest and least elements in <m>B</m>, respectively.  If we define <m>a \vee b</m> and <m>a \wedge b</m> as least upper and greatest lower bounds of <m>\{ a, b\}</m>, then <m>B</m> is a Boolean algebra by Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-partial-order" />, Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-distributive-lattice" />, and our hypothesis.</p>
				</proof>

			<p>Many other identities hold in Boolean algebras. Some of these identities are listed in the following theorem.</p>

			<p>We will show that any finite Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra obtained by taking the power set of some finite set <m>X</m>. We will need a few lemmas and definitions before we prove this result. Let <m>B</m> be a finite Boolean algebra. An element <m>a \in B</m> is  an <term>atom</term><index><main>Atom</main></index><index><main>Boolean algebra</main><sub>atom in a</sub></index> of <m>B</m> if <m>a \neq O</m> and <m>a \wedge b = a</m> for all nonzero <m>b \in B</m>. Equivalently, <m>a</m> is an atom of <m>B</m> if there is no nonzero <m>b \in B</m> distinct from <m>a</m> such that <m>O \preceq b \preceq a</m>.</p>
 
			<lemma>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>B</m> be a finite Boolean algebra. If <m>b</m> is a nonzero element of <m>B</m>, then there is an atom <m>a</m> in <m>B</m> such that <m>a \preceq b</m>.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>If <m>b</m> is an atom, let <m>a =b</m>. Otherwise, choose an element <m>b_1</m>, not equal to <m>O</m> or <m>b</m>, such that <m>b_1 \preceq b</m>. We are guaranteed that this is possible since <m>b</m> is not an atom. If <m>b_1</m> is an atom, then we are done.  If not, choose <m>b_2</m>, not equal to <m>O</m> or <m>b_1</m>, such that  <m>b_2 \preceq b_1</m>. Again, if <m>b_2</m> is an atom, let <m>a = b_2</m>. Continuing this process, we can obtain a chain
						<me>O \preceq \cdots \preceq b_3 \preceq b_2 \preceq b_1 \preceq b.</me>
					Since <m>B</m> is a finite Boolean algebra, this chain must be finite.  That is, for some <m>k</m>, <m>b_k</m> is an atom. Let <m>a = b_k</m>.</p>

				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Since <m>a \wedge b</m> is the greatest lower bound of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, we know that <m>a \wedge b \preceq a</m>.  Hence, either <m>a \wedge b = a</m> or <m>a \wedge b = O</m>. However, if <m>a \wedge b = a</m>, then either <m>a \preceq b</m> or <m>a = O</m>.

		<title>The Algebra of Electrical Circuits</title>
 
		<p>The usefulness of Boolean algebras has become increasingly apparent over the past several decades with the development of the modern computer. The circuit design of computer chips can be expressed in terms of Boolean algebras. In this section we will develop the Boolean algebra of electrical circuits and switches; however, these results can easily be generalized to the design of integrated computer circuitry.</p>
 
		<p>A <term>switch</term><index><main>Switch</main><sub>definition of</sub></index> is a device, located at some point in an electrical circuit, that controls the flow of current through the circuit. Each switch has two possible states: it can be <term>open</term>,<index><main>Switch</main><sub>open</sub></index> and not allow the passage of current through the circuit,  or a it can be <term>closed</term>,<index><main>Switch</main><sub>closed</sub></index> and allow the passage of current. These states are mutually exclusive. We require that every switch be in one state or the other: a switch cannot be open and closed at the same time.  Also, if one switch is always in the same state as another, we will denote both by the same letter; that is, two switches that are both labeled with the same letter <m>a</m> will always be open at the same time and closed at the same time.</p>

		<p>Given two switches, we can construct two fundamental types of circuits. Two switches <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are in <term>series</term><index><main>Circuit</main><sub>series</sub></index> if they make up a circuit of the type that is illustrated in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-a-wedge-b" />. Current can pass between the terminals <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> in a series circuit only if both of the switches <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are closed. We will denote this combination of switches by <m>a \wedge b</m>. Two switches <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are in <term>parallel</term><index><main>Circuit</main><sub>parallel</sub></index> if they form a circuit of the type that appears in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-a-vee-b" />.  In the case of a parallel circuit, current can pass between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> if either one of the switches is closed.  We denote a parallel combination of circuits <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> by <m>a \vee b</m>.</p>

		<p>We can build more complicated electrical circuits out of series and parallel circuits by replacing any switch in the circuit with one of these two fundamental types of circuits. Circuits constructed in this manner are called <term>series-parallel circuits</term><index><main>Circuit</main><sub>series-parallel</sub></index>.</p>
 
		<p>We will consider two circuits equivalent if they act the same. That is, if we set the switches in equivalent circuits exactly the same we will obtain the same result.  For example, in a series circuit <m>a \wedge b</m> is exactly the same as <m>b \wedge a</m>.  Notice that this is exactly the commutative law for Boolean algebras. In fact, the set of all series-parallel circuits forms a Boolean algebra under the operations of <m>\vee</m> and <m>\wedge</m>. We can use diagrams to verify the different axioms of a Boolean algebra. The distributive law, <m>a \wedge ( b \vee c ) = (a \wedge b ) \vee ( a \wedge c )</m>, is illustrated in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-boolean-distributive" />.  If <m>a</m> is a switch, then <m>a'</m> is the switch that is always open when <m>a</m> is closed and always closed when <m>a</m> is open. A circuit that is always closed is <m>I</m> in our algebra; a circuit that is always open is <m>O</m>. The laws for <m>a \wedge a' = O</m> and <m>a \vee a' = I</m> are shown in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-boolean-i-and-o" />.</p>

			<title>Historical Note</title>
 
 			<p>George Boole<index><main>Boole, George</main></index> (1815<ndash />1864) was the first person to study lattices. In 1847, he published <em>The Investigation of the Laws of Thought</em>, a book in which he used lattices to formalize logic and the calculus of propositions. Boole believed that mathematics was the study of form rather than of content; that is, he was not so much concerned with what he was calculating as with how he was calculating it.  Boole's work was carried on by his friend Augustus De Morgan<index><main>De Morgan, Augustus</main></index> (1806<ndash />1871).  De Morgan observed  that the principle of duality often held in set theory, as is illustrated by De Morgan's laws for set theory. He believed, as did Boole, that mathematics was the study of symbols and abstract operations.</p>
 
			<p>Set theory and logic were further advanced by such mathematicians as Alfred North Whitehead<index><main>Whitehead, Alfred North</main></index> (1861<ndash />1947), Bertrand Russell<index><main>Russell, Bertrand</main></index> (1872<ndash />1970), and David Hilbert<index><main>Hilbert, David</main></index> (1862<ndash />1943). In <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, Whitehead and Russell attempted to show the connection between mathematics and logic by the deduction of the natural number system from the rules of formal logic. If the natural numbers could be determined from logic itself, then so could much of the rest of existing mathematics.  Hilbert attempted to build up mathematics by using symbolic logic in a way that would prove the consistency of mathematics. His approach was dealt a mortal blow by Kurt Gödel<index><main>Gödel, Kurt</main></index> (1906<ndash />1978), who proved that there will always be <q>undecidable</q> problems in any sufficiently rich axiomatic system; that is, that in any mathematical system of any consequence, there will always be statements that can never be proven either true or false.</p>
 
 			<p>As often occurs, this basic research in pure mathematics later became indispensable in a wide variety of applications. Boolean algebras and logic have become essential in the design of the large-scale integrated circuitry found on today's computer chips. Sociologists have used lattices and Boolean algebras to model social hierarchies; biologists have used them to describe biosystems.</p>
