  <title>Lattices and Boolean Algebras</title>
  <introduction permid="bZx">
    <p permid="dWb">
      The axioms of a ring give structure to the operations of addition and multiplication on a set.
      However, we can construct algebraic structures,
      known as lattices and Boolean algebras,
      that generalize other types of operations.
      For example,
      the important operations on sets are inclusion, union,
      and intersection.
      Lattices are generalizations of order relations on algebraic spaces,
      such as set inclusion in set theory and inequality in the familiar number systems <m>{\mathbb N}</m>,
      <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>, <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>, and <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
      Boolean algebras generalize the operations of intersection and union.
      Lattices and Boolean algebras have found applications in logic,
      circuit theory, and probability.

      <p permid="sJA">
        We begin the study of lattices and Boolean algebras by generalizing the idea of inequality.
        Recall that a <term>relation</term>
        on a set <m>X</m> is a subset of <m>X \times X</m>.
        A relation <m>P</m> on <m>X</m> is called a
        <term>partial order</term>
            <idx><h>Partial order</h></idx>
        of <m>X</m> if it satisfies the following axioms.

            </p>
          </li>

          <li permid="EQB">
            <p permid="HpI">
              The relation is <term>antisymmetric</term>:
              if <m>(a,b) \in P</m> and <m>(b,a) \in P</m>, then <m>a = b</m>.
            </p>

            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        We will usually write <m>a \preceq b</m> to mean
        <m>(a, b) \in P</m> unless some symbol is naturally associated with a particular partial order,
        such as <m>a \leq b</m> with integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
        or <m>A \subset B</m> with sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
        A set <m>X</m> together with a partial order <m>\preceq</m> is called a
        <term>partially ordered set</term>,
            <idx><h>Partially ordered set</h></idx>

          The set of integers
          (or rationals or reals)
          is a poset where <m>a \leq b</m> has the usual meaning for two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.

              <idx><h>Power set</h></idx>
          of <m>X</m> to be the set of all subsets of <m>X</m>.
          We denote the power set of <m>X</m> by <m>{\mathcal P}(X)</m>.
          For example, let <m>X = \{ a, b, c \}</m>.
          Then <m>{\mathcal P}(X)</m> is  the set of all subsets of the set  <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m>:

          On any power set of a set <m>X</m>, set inclusion,
          <m>\subset</m>, is a partial order.
          We can represent the order on

          The relation is certainly reflexive since

            Therefore, <m>(a \vee b) \vee c</m> is an upper bound of <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m>.
            We now need to show that <m>(a \vee b) \vee c</m> is the least upper bound of <m>\{ a, b, c\}</m>.
            Let <m>u</m> be some other upper bound of <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m>.
            Then <m>a \preceq u</m> and <m>b \preceq u</m>;
            hence, <m>d = a \vee b \preceq u</m>.
            Since <m>c \preceq u</m>,
            it follows that <m>(a \vee b) \vee c = d \vee c \preceq u</m>.
            Therefore, <m>(a \vee b) \vee c</m> must be the least upper  bound of <m>\{ a, b, c\}</m>.
            The argument that shows  <m>a \vee ( b \vee c)</m> is the least upper bound of <m>\{ a, b, c \}</m> is the same.
            Consequently, <m>a \vee ( b \vee c) = (a \vee b) \vee c</m>.

            Since <m>a=(a \vee b) \wedge a = a \wedge (a \vee b)</m>,

        The usefulness of Boolean algebras has become increasingly apparent over the past several decades with the development of the modern computer.
        The circuit design of computer chips can be expressed in terms of Boolean algebras.
        In this section we will develop the Boolean algebra of electrical circuits and switches;
        however, these results can easily be generalized to the design of integrated computer circuitry.

        located at some point in an electrical circuit,
        that controls the flow of current through the circuit.
        Each switch has two possible states:
        it can be <term>open</term>,
            <idx><h>Switch</h><h>open</h></idx>
        and not allow the passage of current through the circuit,
        or a it can be <term>closed</term>,
            <idx><h>Switch</h><h>closed</h></idx>
        and allow the passage of current.
        These states are mutually exclusive.
        We require that every switch be in one state or the other<mdash/>a switch cannot be open and closed at the same time.
        Also, if one switch is always in the same state as another,
        we will denote both by the same letter;
        that is, two switches that are both labeled with the same letter <m>a</m> will always be open at the same time and closed at the same time.

      <p permid="bbv">

        We can build more complicated electrical circuits out of series and parallel circuits by replacing any switch in the circuit with one of these two fundamental types of circuits.
        Circuits constructed in this manner are called
        <term>series-parallel circuits</term>.

      <p permid="npN">
        We will consider two circuits equivalent if they act the same.
        That is, if we set the switches in equivalent circuits exactly the same we will obtain the same result.
        For example, in a series circuit
        <m>a \wedge b</m> is exactly the same as <m>b \wedge a</m>.
        Notice that this is exactly the commutative law for Boolean algebras.
        In fact, the set of all series-parallel circuits forms a Boolean algebra under the operations of <m>\vee</m> and <m>\wedge</m>.
        We can use diagrams to verify the different axioms of a Boolean algebra.
        The distributive law,
        <m>a \wedge ( b \vee c ) = (a \wedge b ) \vee ( a \wedge c )</m>,
        is illustrated in <xref ref="figure-boolean-distributive"/>.
        If <m>a</m> is a switch,
        then <m>a'</m> is the switch that is always open when <m>a</m> is closed and always closed when <m>a</m> is open.
        A circuit that is always closed is <m>I</m> in our algebra;
        a circuit that is always open is <m>O</m>.
        The laws for <m>a \wedge a' = O</m> and
        <m>a \vee a' = I</m> are shown in <xref ref="figure-boolean-i-and-o"/>.

      <p permid="uyN">
        George Boole
            <idx><h>Boole, George</h></idx>
        (1815<ndash/>1864) was the first person to study lattices.
        In 1847, he published <em>The Investigation of the Laws of Thought</em>,
        a book in which he used lattices to formalize logic and the calculus of propositions.
        Boole believed that mathematics was the study of form rather than of content;
        that is, he was not so much concerned with what he was calculating as with how he was calculating it.
        Boole's work was carried on by his friend Augustus De Morgan
            <idx><h>De Morgan, Augustus</h></idx>
        (1806<ndash/>1871).
        De Morgan observed that the principle of duality often held in set theory,
        as is illustrated by De Morgan's laws for set theory.
        He believed, as did Boole,
        that mathematics was the study of symbols and abstract operations.
      </p>

      <p permid="aFW">
        Set theory and logic were further advanced by such mathematicians as Alfred North Whitehead
            <idx><h>Whitehead, Alfred North</h></idx>
        (1861<ndash/>1947), Bertrand Russell
            <idx><h>Russell, Bertrand</h></idx>
        (1872<ndash/>1970), and David Hilbert
            <idx><h>Hilbert, David</h></idx>
        (1862<ndash/>1943).
        In <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, Whitehead and Russell attempted to show the connection between mathematics and logic by the deduction of the natural number system from the rules of formal logic.
        If the natural numbers could be determined from logic itself,
        then so could much of the rest of existing mathematics.
        Hilbert attempted to build up mathematics by using symbolic logic in a way that would prove the consistency of mathematics.
        His approach was dealt a mortal blow by Kurt Gödel
            <idx><h>Gödel, Kurt</h></idx>
        (1906<ndash/>1978), who proved that there will always be <q>undecidable</q>
        problems in any sufficiently rich axiomatic system;
        that is, that in any mathematical system of any consequence,
        there will always be statements that can never be proven either true or false.
      </p>

      <p permid="GNf">
        As often occurs,
        this basic research in pure mathematics later became indispensable in a wide variety of applications.
        Boolean algebras and logic have become essential in the design of the large-scale integrated circuitry found on today's computer chips.
        Sociologists have used lattices and Boolean algebras to model social hierarchies;
        biologists have used them to describe biosystems.

        Sage has support for both partially ordered sets (<q>posets</q>) and lattices,
        and does an excellent job of providing visual depictions of both.

        <xref ref="example-boolean-poset-divisors-24"/> in the text is a good example to replicate as a demonstration of Sage commands.
        We first define the elements of the set <m>X</m>.
      </p>

            <sage permid="QOU">
                <input>
        X = (24).divisors()
        X

                <output>
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24]
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p permid="Tbx">
        One approach to creating the relation is to specify <em>every</em>
        instance where one element is comparable to the another.
        So we build a list of pairs,
        where each pair contains comparable elements,
        with the lesser one first.
        This is the set of relations.
      </p>

            <sage permid="wWd">
                <input>
        R = [(a,b) for a in X for b in X if a.divides(b)]; R

         (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 12), (2, 24), (3, 3), (3, 6),
         (3, 12), (3, 24), (4, 4), (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 24), (6, 6),
         (6, 12), (6, 24), (8, 8), (8, 24), (12, 12), (12, 24), (24, 24)]
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p permid="ziG">
        We construct the poset by giving the the <c>Poset</c>constructor a list containing the elements and the relations.
        We can then easily get a <q>plot</q> of the poset.
        Notice the plot just shows the <q>cover relations</q>
        <mdash/> a minimal set of comparisons which the assumption of transitivity would expand into the set of all the relations.
      </p>

            <sage doctest="not tested" permid="bnZ">
                <input>
        D = Poset([X, R])
        D.plot()
        </input>
                <output>
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p permid="fpP">
        Another approach to creating a <c>Poset</c>is to let the poset constructor run over all the pairs of elements,
        and all we do is give the constructor a way to test if two elements are comparable.
        Our comparison function should expect two elements and then return <c>True</c>or <c>False</c>.
        A <q>lambda</q> function is one way to quickly build such a function.
        This may be a new idea for you,
        but mastering lambda functions can be a great convenience.
        Notice that <q>lambda</q> is a word reserved for just this purpose
        (so, for example,
        <c>lambda</c>is a bad choice for the name of an eigenvalue of a matrix).
        There are other ways to make functions in Sage,
        but a lambda function is quickest when the function is simple.

          (Advanced) For the previous question,

          You can test and illustrate your function by its interaction with specific elements evaluated in the meet and join operations,
