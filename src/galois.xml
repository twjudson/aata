<title>Galois Theory</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>A classic problem of algebra is to find the solutions of a polynomial equation.  The solution to the quadratic equation was known in antiquity.  Italian mathematicians found general solutions to the general cubic and quartic equations in the sixteenth century; however,  attempts to solve the general fifth-degree, or quintic, polynomial were repulsed for the next three hundred years. Certainly, equations such as <m>x^5 - 1 = 0</m> or <m>x^6 - x^3 - 6 = 0</m> could be solved, but no solution like the quadratic formula was found for the general quintic, 
			<me>a x^5 + b x^4 +c x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f = 0.</me>
		Finally, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Ruffini and Abel both found quintics that could not be solved with any formula.  It was Galois, however, who provided the full explanation by showing which polynomials could and could not be solved by formulas.  He discovered the connection between groups and field extensions.  Galois theory demonstrates the strong interdependence of group and field theory, and has had far-reaching implications beyond its original purpose.</p>
 
		<p>In this chapter we will prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.  This result will be used to establish the insolvability of the quintic and to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.</p>

		<title>Field Automorphisms</title>

		<introduction>
 
			<p>Our first task is to establish a link between group theory and field theory by examining automorphisms of fields.</p>
	 
			<proposition>
				<statement>
					<p>The set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is a group under composition of functions.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>If <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are automorphisms of <m>F</m>, then so are <m>\sigma \tau</m> and <m>\sigma^{-1}</m>.  The identity is certainly an automorphism; hence, the set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is indeed a group.</p>
				</proof>
			</proposition>

			<proposition>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>E</m> be a field extension of <m>F</m>.  Then the set of all automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise is a group; that is, the set of all automorphisms <m>\sigma : E \rightarrow E</m> such that <m>\sigma( \alpha ) = \alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha \in F</m> is a group.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>We need only show that the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise is a subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of <m>E</m>.  Let <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> be two automorphisms of <m>E</m> such that <m>\sigma( \alpha ) = \alpha</m> and <m>\tau( \alpha ) = \alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha \in F</m>.  Then <m>\sigma \tau( \alpha ) = \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m> and  <m>\sigma^{-1}( \alpha ) = \alpha</m>.  Since the identity fixes every  element of <m>E</m>, the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that leave elements of  <m>F</m> fixed is a subgroup of the entire group of automorphisms of <m>E</m>.</p>
				</proof>
			</proposition>

			<p>Let <m>E</m> be a field extension of <m>F</m>.  We will denote the full group of automorphisms of <m>E</m> by <m>\aut(E)</m>.  We define the <term>Galois group</term><index><main>Group</main><sub>Galois</sub></index><index><main>Galois group</main></index> of <m>E</m> over <m>F</m> to be the group of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise; that is,
				<me>G(E/F) = \{ \sigma \in \aut(E) : \sigma(\alpha) = \alpha \text{ for all } \alpha \in F  \}.</me>
			If <m>f(x)</m> is a polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>E</m> is the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m>, then we define the Galois group of <m>f(x)</m> to be <m>G(E/F)</m>. <notation><usage>G(E/F)</usage><description>Galois group of <m>E</m> over <m>F</m></description></notation></p>

			<example xml:id="example-galois-complex-conj">
				<p>Complex conjugation, defined by <m>\sigma : a + bi \mapsto a - bi</m>, is an automorphism of the complex numbers.  Since 
					<me>\sigma(a) = \sigma(a + 0i) = a - 0i = a,</me>
				the automorphism defined by complex conjugation must be in <m>G( {\mathbb C} / {\mathbb R} )</m>.</p></example>

			<example xml:id="example-galois-q-sqrt5">
				<p>Consider the fields <m>{\mathbb Q} \subset {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{5}\, ) \subset {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m>.  Then for <m>a, b \in {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{5}\, )</m>,
					<me>\sigma( a + b \sqrt{3}\, ) = a - b \sqrt{3}</me>
				is an automorphism of <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m> leaving <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{5}\, )</m> fixed.  Similarly,
					<me>\tau( a + b \sqrt{5}\, ) = a - b \sqrt{5}</me>
				is an automorphism of <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m> leaving <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m> fixed. The automorphism <m>\mu = \sigma \tau</m> moves both <m>\sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\sqrt{5}</m>.  It will soon be clear that <m>\{ \identity, \sigma, \tau, \mu  \}</m> is the Galois group of <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>. The following table shows that this group is isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
					<me>\begin{array}{c|cccc}
					&amp; \identity &amp; \sigma &amp; \tau &amp; \mu \\

					\tau &amp; \tau &amp; \mu &amp; \identity &amp; \sigma \\
					\mu &amp; \mu &amp; \tau &amp; \sigma &amp; \identity
					\end{array}</me>
				We may also regard the field <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m> as a vector space over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> that has basis <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{15}\, \}</m>.  It is no coincidence that <m>|G( {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ) /{\mathbb Q})| = [{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ):{\mathbb Q})] = 4</m>.</p>

			<corollary>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>F</m> be a finite field with a finite extension <m>E</m> such that <m>[E:F]=k</m>. Then <m>G(E/F)</m> is cyclic of order <m>k</m>.</p>
				</statement>
	<!-- Corrected statement of the corollary.  Suggested by K. Wenholz. - TWJ 5/15/2012 -->
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>p</m> be the characteristic of <m>E</m> and <m>F</m> and assume that the orders of <m>E</m> and <m>F</m> are <m>p^m</m> and <m>p^n</m>, respectively.  Then <m>nk = m</m>.  We can also assume that <m>E</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^{p^m} - x</m> over a subfield of order <m>p</m>.  Therefore, <m>E</m> must also be the splitting field of <m>x^{p^m} - x</m> over <m>F</m>.  Applying Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-extension-order" />, we find that <m>|G(E/F)| = k</m>.</p>   

					<p>To prove that <m>G(E/F)</m> is cyclic, we must find a generator for <m>G(E/F)</m>.  Let <m>\sigma : E \rightarrow E</m> be defined by <m>\sigma(\alpha) = \alpha^{p^n}</m>.  We claim that <m>\sigma</m> is the element in <m>G(E/F)</m> that we are seeking.  We first need to show that <m>\sigma</m> is in <m>\aut(E)</m>.  If <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are in <m>E</m>,   
						<me>\sigma(\alpha + \beta) = (\alpha + \beta)^{p^n} = \alpha^{p^n} + \beta^{p^n} = \sigma(\alpha) + \sigma(\beta)</me>
					by Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="lemma-freshmans-dream" />  Also, it is easy to show that <m>\sigma(\alpha \beta) = \sigma( \alpha ) \sigma( \beta )</m>. Since <m>\sigma</m> is a nonzero homomorphism of fields, it must be injective.  It must also be onto, since <m>E</m> is a finite field.  We know that <m>\sigma</m> must be in <m>G(E/F)</m>, since <m>F</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^{p^n} - x</m> over the base field of order <m>p</m>. This means that <m>\sigma</m> leaves every element in <m>F</m> fixed.  Finally, we must show that the order of <m>\sigma</m> is <m>k</m>. By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-extension-order" />, we know that
						<me>\sigma^k( \alpha ) = \alpha^{p^{nk}} = \alpha^{p^m} = \alpha</me>
					is the identity of <m>G( E/F)</m>.  However, <m>\sigma^r</m> cannot be the identity for <m>1 \leq r \lt k</m>; otherwise, <m>x^{p^{nr}} - x</m> would have <m>p^m</m> roots, which is impossible.</p>

Certainly the group <m>H = \{ \identity, \sigma, \tau, \mu \}</m> is a subgroup of <m>G({\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )/{\mathbb Q})</m>; however,  <m>H</m> must be all of <m>G({\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )/{\mathbb Q})</m>, since

			<example xml:id="example-galois-group-x4">
				<p>Let us compute the Galois group of

				over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>. We know that <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible by Exercise<nbsp /><xref ref="exercise-poly-cyclotomic-polynomials" /> in Chapter<nbsp /><xref ref="poly" />.  Furthermore, since <m>(x -1)f(x) = x^5 -1</m>, we can use DeMoivre's Theorem to determine that the roots of <m>f(x)</m> are <m>\omega^i</m>,  where  <m>i = 1, \ldots, 4</m> and 
					<me>\omega = \cos(2 \pi / 5 ) + i \sin(2 \pi / 5 ).</me>
				Hence, the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> must be <m>{\mathbb Q}(\omega)</m>.  We can define automorphisms <m>\sigma_i</m> of <m>{\mathbb Q}(\omega )</m> by <m>\sigma_i( \omega ) = \omega^i</m> for <m>i = 1, \ldots, 4</m>.  It is easy to check that these are indeed distinct automorphisms in <m>G( {\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q} )</m>.  Since 
					<me>[{\mathbb Q}( \omega) : {\mathbb Q}] = | G( {\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q})| = 4,</me>
				the <m>\sigma_i</m>'s must be all of <m>G( {\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q} )</m>. Therefore, <m>G({\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q})\cong {\mathbb Z}_4</m> since <m>\omega</m> is a generator for the Galois group.</p>

					for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> with <m>j \neq 1</m>. Therefore, <m>a( \beta - \beta_j ) \neq \alpha_i - \alpha</m>. Let <m>\gamma = \alpha + a \beta</m>. Then
						<me>\gamma = \alpha + a \beta \neq \alpha_i + a \beta_j;</me>
					hence, <m>\gamma - a \beta_j \neq \alpha_i</m> for all <m>i, j</m> with <m>j \neq 1</m>.  Define <m>h(x) \in F( \gamma )[x]</m> by <m>h(x) = f( \gamma - ax)</m>. Then <m>h( \beta ) = f( \alpha ) = 0</m>. However, <m>h( \beta_j ) \neq 0</m> for <m>j \neq 1</m>. Hence, <m>h(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> have a single common factor in <m>F( \gamma )[x]</m>; that is, the irreducible polynomial of <m>\beta</m> over <m>F( \gamma )</m> must be linear, since <m>\beta</m> is the only zero common to both <m>g(x)</m> and <m>h(x)</m>. So <m>\beta \in F( \gamma )</m> and <m>\alpha = \gamma - a \beta</m> is in <m>F( \gamma )</m>. Hence, <m>F( \alpha, \beta ) = F( \gamma )</m>.</p>

		<title>The Fundamental Theorem</title>
 
		<introduction>

			<p>The goal of this section is to prove the Fundamental Theorem of	Galois Theory. This theorem explains the connection between the subgroups of <m>G(E/F)</m> and the intermediate fields between <m>E</m> and <m>F</m>.</p>
	 
			<proposition>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>\{\sigma_i : i \in I  \}</m> be a  collection of automorphisms of a field <m>F</m>.  Then <notation><usage>F_{\{\sigma_i \}}</usage><description>field fixed by the automorphism <m>\sigma_i</m></description></notation>
						<me>F_{\{\sigma_i \}} = \{ a \in F : \sigma_i(a) = a \text{ for all } \sigma_i \}</me>
					is a subfield of <m>F</m>.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>\sigma_i(a) = a</m> and <m>\sigma_i(b)=b</m>. Then
						<me>\sigma_i(a \pm b) = \sigma_i(a) \pm \sigma_i(b) = a \pm b</me>
					and
						<me>\sigma_i(a b) = \sigma_i(a) \sigma_i(b) = a  b.</me>
					If <m>a \neq 0</m>, then  <m>\sigma_i(a^{-1}) = [\sigma_i(a)]^{-1} = a^{-1}</m>. Finally, <m>\sigma_i(0) = 0</m> and <m>\sigma_i(1)=1</m> since <m>\sigma_i</m> is an automorphism.</p>
				</proof>

			<corollary>

					<p>Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>G</m> be a subgroup of <m>\aut(F)</m>. Then <notation><usage>F_G</usage><description>field fixed by the automorphism group <m>G</m></description></notation>

			<p>The subfield <m>F_{ \{\sigma_i \} }</m> of <m>F</m> is called the <term>fixed field</term><index><main>Field</main><sub>fixed</sub></index> of <m>\{ \sigma_i \}</m>. The field fixed for a subgroup <m>G</m> of <m>\aut(F)</m> will be denoted by <m>F_G</m>.</p>

			<proposition xml:id="proposition-fixed-field">
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>E</m> be a splitting field over <m>F</m> of a separable polynomial. Then <m>E_{G(E/F)} = F</m>.</p>

				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>G = G(E/F)</m>. Clearly, <m>F \subset E_G \subset E</m>. Also, <m>E</m> must be a splitting field of <m>E_G</m> and <m>G(E/F) = G(E/E_G)</m>. By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-extension-order" />,

					Therefore, <m>[E_G : F ] =1</m>. Consequently,  <m>E_G = F</m>.</p>
				</proof>
			</proposition>
	 
			<p>A large number of mathematicians first learned Galois theory from Emil Artin's monograph on the subject [1]. The very clever proof of the following lemma is due to Artin.</p>

			<lemma>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>G</m> be a finite group of automorphisms of <m>E</m> and let <m>F = E_G</m>. Then <m>[E:F] \leq |G|</m>.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Let <m>|G| = n</m>. We must show that any set of <m>n + 1</m> elements <m>\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_{n + 1}</m> in <m>E</m> is linearly dependent over <m>F</m>; that is, we need to find elements <m>a_i \in F</m>, not all zero, such that 
						<me>a_1 \alpha_1 + a_2 \alpha_2 + \cdots + a_{n + 1} \alpha_{n + 1} = 0.</me>
					Suppose that <m>\sigma_1 = \identity, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n</m> are the automorphisms in <m>G</m>. The homogeneous system of linear equations 
						<md>
							<mrow>\sigma_1( \alpha_1 ) x_1 + \sigma_1(\alpha_2) x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_1(\alpha_{n + 1} ) x_{n + 1} &amp; = 0</mrow>
							<mrow>\sigma_2( \alpha_1 ) x_1 + \sigma_2(\alpha_2) x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_2(\alpha_{n + 1} ) x_{n + 1} &amp; = 0</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; \vdots &amp;</mrow>
							<mrow>\sigma_n( \alpha_1 ) x_1 + \sigma_n(\alpha_2) x_2 + \cdots + \sigma_n(\alpha_{n + 1} ) x_{n + 1} &amp; = 0</mrow>
						</md>
					has more unknowns than equations. From linear algebra we know that this system has a nontrivial solution, say <m>x_i = a_i</m> for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, n + 1</m>. Since <m>\sigma_1</m> is the identity, the first equation translates to
						<me>a_1 \alpha_1 +  a_2 \alpha_2  + \cdots + a_{n + 1} \alpha_{n + 1} = 0.</me>
					The problem is that some of the <m>a_i</m>'s may be in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>. We must show that this is impossible.</p>

	<!-- Corrected typo.  Suggested by K. Brooks. - TWJ 6/15/2012 -->
	 
					<p>Suppose that at least one of the <m>a_i</m>'s is in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>. By rearranging the <m>\alpha_i</m>'s we may assume that <m>a_1</m> is nonzero. Since any nonzero multiple of a solution is also a solution, we can also assume that <m>a_1 = 1</m>. Of all possible solutions fitting this description, we choose the one with the smallest number of nonzero terms. Again, by rearranging <m>\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{n + 1}</m> if necessary, we can assume that <m>a_2</m> is in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>. Since <m>F</m> is the subfield of <m>E</m> that is fixed elementwise by <m>G</m>, there exists a <m>\sigma_i</m> in <m>G</m> such that <m>\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2</m>. Applying <m>\sigma_i</m> to each equation in the system, we end up with the same homogeneous system, since <m>G</m> is a group. Therefore, <m>x_1 = \sigma_i(a_1) = 1</m>, <m>x_2 = \sigma_i(a_2)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_{n + 1} = \sigma_i(a_{n+1} )</m> is also a solution of the original system. We know that a linear combination of two solutions of a homogeneous system is also a solution; consequently,   
						<md>
							<mrow>x_1 &amp; = 1 -1 = 0</mrow>
							<mrow>x_2 &amp; = a_2 - \sigma_i(a_2)</mrow>
							<mrow>&amp; \vdots &amp;</mrow>
							<mrow>x_{n + 1} &amp; = a_{n + 1} - \sigma_i(a_{n + 1})</mrow>
						</md>
					must be another solution of the system. This is a nontrivial solution because <m>\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2</m>, and has fewer nonzero entries than our original solution. This is a contradiction, since the number of nonzero solutions to our original solution was assumed to be minimal. We can therefore conclude that <m>a_1, \ldots, a_{n + 1} \in F</m>.</p>
				</proof>
			</lemma>
	 
			<p>Let <m>E</m> be an algebraic extension of <m>F</m>. If every irreducible polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> with a root in <m>E</m> has all of its roots in <m>E</m>, then <m>E</m> is called a <term>normal extension</term><index><main>Extension</main><sub>normal</sub></index><index><main>Normal extension</main></index> of <m>F</m>; that is, every irreducible polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> containing a root in <m>E</m> is the product of linear factors in <m>E[x]</m>.</p> 
			<theorem>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>E</m> be a field extension of <m>F</m>. Then the following statements are equivalent.
						<ol>

							<li><p><m>E</m> is a finite, normal, separable extension of <m>F</m>.</p></li>

							<li><p><m>E</m> is a splitting field over <m>F</m> of a separable polynomial.</p></li>

							<li><p><m>F = E_G</m> for some finite group <m>G</m> of automorphisms of <m>E</m>.</p></li>

						</ol></p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>(1) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (2). Let <m>E</m> be a finite, normal, separable extension of <m>F</m>. By the Primitive Element Theorem, we can find an  <m>\alpha</m> in <m>E</m> such that <m>E = F(\alpha)</m>. Let <m>f(x)</m> be the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m>. The field <m>E</m> must contain all of the roots of <m>f(x)</m> since it is a normal extension <m>F</m>; hence, <m>E</m> is a splitting field for <m>f(x)</m>.</p>
	 
					<p>(2) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (3). Let <m>E</m> be the splitting field over <m>F</m> of a separable polynomial. By Proposition<nbsp /><xref ref="proposition-fixed-field" />, <m>E_{G(E/F)} = F</m>. Since <m>| G(E/F)| = [E:F]</m>, this is a finite group.</p>
	 
					<p>(3) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (1). Let <m>F = E_G</m> for some finite group of automorphisms <m>G</m> of <m>E</m>. Since <m>[E:F] \leq |G|</m>, <m>E</m> is a finite extension of <m>F</m>. To show that <m>E</m> is a finite, normal extension of  <m>F</m>, let <m>f(x) \in F[x]</m> be an irreducible monic polynomial that has a root <m>\alpha</m> in <m>E</m>. We must show that <m>f(x)</m> is the product of distinct linear factors in <m>E[x]</m>. By Proposition<nbsp /><xref ref="proposition-roots-permute" />, automorphisms in <m>G</m> permute the roots of <m>f(x)</m> lying in <m>E</m>. Hence, if we let <m>G</m> act on <m>\alpha</m>, we can obtain distinct roots <m>\alpha_1 = \alpha, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n</m> in <m>E</m>. Let <m>g(x) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} (x -\alpha_i)</m>. Then <m>g(x)</m> is separable over <m>F</m> and <m>g( \alpha ) = 0</m>. Any automorphism <m>\sigma</m> in <m>G</m> permutes the factors of <m>g(x)</m> since it permutes these roots; hence, when <m>\sigma</m> acts on <m>g(x)</m>, it must fix the coefficients of <m>g(x)</m>. Therefore, the coefficients of <m>g(x)</m> must be in <m>F</m>. Since <m>\deg g(x) \leq \deg f(x)</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>, <m>f(x) = g(x)</m>.</p>
				</proof>
			</theorem>
	 
			<corollary>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>K</m> be a field extension of <m>F</m> such that <m>F = K_G</m> for some finite group of automorphisms <m>G</m> of <m>K</m>. Then <m>G = G(K/F)</m>.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>Since <m>F = K_G</m>, <m>G</m> is a subgroup of <m>G(K/F)</m>. Hence,
						<me>[K : F ]  \leq |G| \leq |G(K/F)| = [K:F].</me>
					It follows that <m>G = G(K/F)</m>, since they must have the same order.</p>

			<p>We are now ready to state and prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.</p>
 
			<theorem xml:id="theorem-fundamental-galois">
				<title>Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory</title>
				<index><main>Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory</main></index>
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>F</m> be a finite field or a field of characteristic zero. If <m>E</m> is a finite normal extension of <m>F</m> with Galois group <m>G(E/F)</m>, then the following statements are true.
						<ol>

							<li><p>The map <m>K \mapsto G(E/K)</m> is a bijection of subfields <m>K</m> of <m>E</m> containing <m>F</m> with the subgroups of <m>G(E/F)</m>.</p></li>

							<li><p>If <m>F \subset K \subset E</m>, then 
								<me>[E:K] = |G(E/K)| \text{ and } [K:F] = [G(E/F):G(E/K)].</me></p></li>

							<li><p><m>F \subset K \subset L \subset E</m> if and only if <m>\{ \identity \} \subset G(E/L) \subset G(E/K) \subset G(E/F)</m>.</p></li>

							<li><p><m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m> if and only if <m>G(E/K)</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G( E/F)</m>. In this case
								<me>G(K/F) \cong G(E/F) / G( E/K ).</me></p></li>

						</ol></p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>(1) Suppose that <m>G(E/K) = G(E/L) = G</m>. Both <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> are fixed fields  of <m>G</m>; hence, <m>K=L</m> and the map defined by <m>K \mapsto G(E/K)</m> is one-to-one. To show that the map is onto, let <m>G</m> be a subgroup of <m>G(E/F)</m> and <m>K</m> be the field fixed by <m>G</m>. Then <m>F \subset K \subset E</m>; consequently, <m>E</m> is a normal extension of <m>K</m>. Thus, <m>G(E/K) = G</m> and the map <m>K \mapsto G(E/K)</m> is a bijection.</p>
 
					<p>(2) By Theorem <xref ref="theorem-extension-order" />, <m>|G(E/K)| = [E:K]</m>; therefore, 
						<me>|G(E/F)| = [G(E/F):G(E/K)] \cdot |G(E/K)| = [E:F] = [E:K][K:F].</me>
					Thus, <m>[K:F] = [G(E/F):G(E/K)]</m>.</p>
 
					<p>(3) Statement (3) is illustrated in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-galois-2" />. We leave the proof of this property as an exercise.</p>

 
					<p>(4) This part takes a little more work. Let <m>K</m> be a normal extension of <m>F</m>. If <m>\sigma</m> is in <m>G(E/F)</m> and <m>\tau</m> is in <m>G(E/K)</m>, we need to show that <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma</m> is in <m>G(E/K)</m>; that is, we need to show that <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha \in K</m>. Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m>. Then <m>\sigma( \alpha )</m> is also a root of <m>f(x)</m> lying in <m>K</m>, since <m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m>. Hence, <m>\tau( \sigma( \alpha )) = \sigma( \alpha )</m> or <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m>.</p>
 
 
					<p>Conversely, let <m>G(E/K)</m> be a normal subgroup of <m>G(E/F)</m>. We need to show that <m>F = K_{G(K/F)}</m>. Let <m>\tau \in G(E/K)</m>. For all <m>\sigma \in G(E/F)</m> there exists a <m>\overline{\tau} \in G(E/K)</m> such that <m>\tau \sigma = \sigma \overline{\tau}</m>.  Consequently, for all <m>\alpha \in K</m>
						<me>\tau( \sigma( \alpha ) ) = \sigma( \overline{\tau}( \alpha ) ) = \sigma( \alpha );</me>
					hence, <m>\sigma( \alpha )</m> must be in the fixed field of <m>G(E/K)</m>. Let <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> be the restriction of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>. Then <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> is an automorphism of <m>K</m> fixing <m>F</m>, since <m>\sigma( \alpha ) \in K</m> for all <m>\alpha \in K</m>; hence, <m>\overline{\sigma} \in G(K/F)</m>. Next, we will show that the fixed field of <m>G(K/F)</m> is <m>F</m>. Let <m>\beta</m> be an element in <m>K</m> that is fixed by all automorphisms in <m>G(K/F)</m>.  In particular, <m>\overline{\sigma}(\beta) = \beta</m> for all <m>\sigma \in G(E/F)</m>.  Therefore, <m>\beta</m> belongs to the fixed field <m>F</m> of <m>G(E/F)</m>.</p>
 
 
					<p>Finally, we must show that when <m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m>, 
						<me>G(K/F) \cong G(E/F) / G(E/K).</me>
					For <m>\sigma \in G(E/F)</m>, let <m>\sigma_K</m> be the automorphism of <m>K</m> obtained by restricting <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>. Since <m>K</m> is a normal extension, the argument in the preceding paragraph shows that <m>\sigma_K \in G( K/F)</m>. Consequently, we have a map <m>\phi:G(E/F) \rightarrow G(K/F)</m> defined by <m>\sigma \mapsto \sigma_K</m>. This map is a group homomorphism since
						<me>\phi( \sigma \tau )  = (\sigma \tau)_K  = \sigma_K \tau_K  = \phi( \sigma) \phi( \tau ).</me>
					The kernel of <m>\phi</m> is <m>G(E/K)</m>.  By (2), 
						<me>|G(E/F)| / |G(E/K)| = [K:F] = |G(K/F)|.</me>
					Hence, the image of <m>\phi</m> is <m>G(K/F)</m> and <m>\phi</m> is onto. Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have
						<me>G(K/F) \cong G(E/F) / G( E/K ).</me></p>

To see this, notice that <m>f(x)</m> factors as <m>(x^2 + \sqrt{2}\, )(x^2 - \sqrt{2}\, )</m>; hence, the roots of <m>f(x)</m> are <m>\pm \sqrt[4]{2}</m> and <m>\pm \sqrt[4]{2}\, i</m>. We first adjoin the root <m>\sqrt[4]{2}</m> to <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and then adjoin the root <m>i</m> of <m>x^2 + 1</m> to <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}\, )</m>. The splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> is then <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}\, )(i) = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[4]{2}, i )</m>.</p> 
 
				<p>Since <m>[ {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[4]{2}\, ) : {\mathbb Q}] = 4</m> and <m>i</m> is not in <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[4]{2}\, )</m>, it must be the case that <m>[ {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[4]{2}, i ): {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}\, )] = 2</m>. Hence, <m>[ {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[4]{2}, i ):{\mathbb Q}] = 8</m>. The set
					<me>\{ 1, \sqrt[4]{2}, (\sqrt[4]{2}\, )^2, (\sqrt[4]{2}\, )^3, i, i \sqrt[4]{2}, i (\sqrt[4]{2}\, )^2, i(\sqrt[4]{2}\, )^3 \}</me>
				is a basis of <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[4]{2}, i )</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>. The lattice of field extensions of <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> contained in <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[4]{2}, i)</m> is illustrated in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-galois-3" />(a).</p>
 
<!-- Corrected the automorphism sigma.  Suggested by R. Beezer. - TWJ 4/14/2011 -->

				<p>The Galois group <m>G</m> of <m>f(x)</m> must be of order 8. Let <m>\sigma</m> be the automorphism defined by <m>\sigma( \sqrt[4]{2}\, ) = i \sqrt[4]{2}</m> and <m>\sigma( i ) = i</m>, and <m>\tau</m> be the automorphism defined by complex conjugation; that is, <m>\tau(i ) = -i</m>. Then <m>G</m> has an element of order 4 and an element of order 2. It is easy to verify by direct computation that the elements of <m>G</m> are <m>\{ \identity, \sigma, \sigma^2,  \sigma^3, \tau, \sigma \tau, \sigma^2 \tau, \sigma^3 \tau \}</m> and that the relations <m>\tau^2 = \identity</m>, <m>\sigma^4 = \identity</m>, and <m>\tau \sigma \tau = \sigma^{-1}</m> are satisfied; hence, <m>G</m> must be isomorphic to <m>D_4</m>.

			<title>Historical Note</title>
 
			<p>Solutions for the cubic and quartic equations were discovered in the 1500s. Attempts to find solutions for the quintic equations puzzled some of history's best mathematicians.  In 1798, P. Ruffini<index><main>Ruffini, P.</main></index> submitted a paper that claimed no such solution could be found; however, the paper was not well received. In 1826, Niels Henrik Abel<index><main>Abel, Niels Henrik</main></index> (1802<ndash />1829) finally offered the first correct proof that quintics are not always solvable by radicals.</p>
 
			<p>Abel inspired the work of Évariste Galois<index><main>Galois, Évariste</main></index>. Born in 1811, Galois began to display extraordinary mathematical talent at the age of 14. He applied for entrance to the École Polytechnique several times; however, he had great difficulty meeting the formal entrance requirements, and the examiners failed to recognize his mathematical genius. He was finally accepted at the École Normale in 1829.</p>  

			<p>Galois worked to develop a theory of solvability for polynomials.  In 1829, at the age of 17, Galois presented two papers on the solution of algebraic equations to the Académie des Sciences de Paris. These papers were sent to Cauchy, who subsequently lost them. A third paper was submitted to Fourier, who died before he could read the paper. Another paper was presented, but was not published until 1846.</p> 
 
			<p>Galois' democratic sympathies led him into the Revolution of 1830. He was expelled from school and sent to prison for his part in the turmoil. After his release in 1832, he was drawn into a duel possibly over a love affair. Certain that he would be killed, he spent the evening before his death outlining his work and his basic ideas for research in a long letter to his friend Chevalier. He was indeed dead the next day, at the age of 20.</p>

			<title>Solvability by Radicals</title>

<!-- Major clean up of the section -->
<!-- TWJ 3/5/2013 -->
 
			<p>Throughout this section we shall assume that all fields have characteristic zero to ensure that irreducible polynomials do not have multiple roots. The immediate goal of this section is to determine when the roots of a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> can be computed with a finite number of operations on the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m>. The allowable operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of <m>n</m>th roots. Certainly the solution to the quadratic equation, <m>a x^2 + b x +c = 0</m>, illustrates this process:
				<me>x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.</me>
			The only one of these operations that might demand a larger field is the taking of <m>n</m>th roots.  We are led to the following definition.</p>
 
			<p>An extension field <m>E</m> of a field <m>F</m> is an <term>extension by radicals</term><index><main>Extension</main><sub>radical</sub></index> if there exists a chain of subfields
				<me>F = F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq F_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F_r = E</me>
			such for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, r</m>, we have  <m>F_i = F_{i - 1}(\alpha_i)</m> and <m>\alpha_i^{n_i} \in F_{i-1}</m> for some positive integer <m>n_i</m>. A polynomial <m>f(x)</m> is <term>solvable by radicals</term><index><main>Solvability by radicals</main></index> over <m>F</m> if the splitting field <m>K</m> of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m> is contained in an extension of <m>F</m> by radicals. Our goal is to arrive at criteria that will tell us whether or not a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> is solvable by radicals by examining the Galois group <m>f(x)</m>.</p>
 
			<p>The easiest polynomial to solve by radicals is one of the form <m>x^n - a</m>. As we discussed in Chapter<nbsp /><xref ref="cyclic" />, the roots of <m>x^n - 1</m> are called the <term>nth roots of unity</term><index><main><m>n</m>th root of unity</main></index>.  These roots are a finite subgroup of the splitting field of <m>x^n -1</m>. By Corollary<nbsp /><xref ref="corollary-cyclic-group-finite-field" />, the <m>n</m>th roots of unity form a cyclic group.  Any generator of this group is called a <term>primitive nth root of unity</term><index><main>Primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity</main></index>.</p>

			<example xml:id="example-galois-group-xn-1">
				<p>The polynomial <m>x^n - 1</m> is solvable by radicals over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>. The roots of this polynomial are <m>1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{n - 1}</m>, where
					<me>\omega = \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi}{n} \right) +  i \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi}{n} \right).</me>
				The splitting field of <m>x^n - 1</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is <m>{\mathbb Q}(\omega)</m>.</p>
			</example>
 
			<p>We shall prove that a polynomial is solvable by radicals if its Galois group is solvable. Recall that a subnormal series of a group <m>G</m> is a finite sequence of subgroups
				<me>G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \},</me>
			where <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m>.  A group <m>G</m> is solvable  if it has a subnormal series <m>\{ H_i \}</m> such that all of the factor  groups <m>H_{i+1} /H_i</m> are abelian.  For example, if we examine the series <m>\{ \identity \} \subset A_3 \subset S_3</m>, we see that <m>S_3</m> is solvable.  On the other hand, <m>S_5</m> is not solvable, by Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-an-simple" />.</p>

			<lemma xml:id="lemma-xn-a-solvable">
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic zero and <m>E</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^n - a</m> over <m>F</m> with <m>a \in F</m>. Then <m>G(E/F)</m> is a solvable group.</p>
				</statement>
				<proof>
					<p>The roots of <m>x^n - a</m> are <m>\sqrt[n]{a}, \omega	\sqrt[n]{a}, \ldots, \omega^{n-1} \sqrt[n]{a}</m>, where <m>\omega</m> is a primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity.  Suppose that <m>F</m> contains all of its <m>n</m>th roots of unity.  If <m>\zeta</m> is one of the roots of  <m>x^n - a</m>, then distinct roots of <m>x^n - a</m> are <m>\zeta, \omega \zeta, \ldots, \omega^{n - 1} \zeta</m>, and <m>E = F(\zeta)</m>. Since <m>G(E/F)</m> permutes the roots <m>x^n - a</m>, the elements in  <m>G(E/F)</m> must be determined by their action on these roots. Let <m>\sigma</m>  and <m>\tau</m> be in <m>G(E/F)</m> and suppose that <m>\sigma( \zeta ) = \omega^i  \zeta</m> and <m>\tau( \zeta ) = \omega^j \zeta</m>. If <m>F</m> contains the roots of unity, then 
						<me>\sigma \tau( \zeta ) = \sigma( \omega^j \zeta) = \omega^j \sigma( \zeta ) = \omega^{i+j} \zeta = \omega^i \tau( \zeta ) = \tau( \omega^i \zeta ) = \tau \sigma( \zeta ).</me>
					Therefore, <m>\sigma \tau = \tau \sigma</m> and <m>G(E/F)</m> is abelian, and
					<m>G(E/F)</m> must be solvable.</p>

<!-- typo correction in proof.  Suggested by L.Handricks and K. Kelley. -->
<!-- TWJ - 5/3/2013 -->
 
					<p>Now suppose that <m>F</m> does not contain a primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity. Let <m>\omega</m> be a generator of the cyclic group of the <m>n</m>th roots of unity.  Let <m>\alpha</m> be a zero of <m>x^n - a</m>. Since <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\omega \alpha</m> are both in the splitting field of <m>x^n - a</m>, <m>\omega = (\omega \alpha)/ \alpha</m> is also in <m>E</m>. Let <m>K = F( \omega)</m>. Then <m>F \subset K \subset E</m>. Since <m>K</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^n - 1</m>, <m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m>.  Therefore, any automorphism <m>\sigma</m> in <m>G(F( \omega)/ F)</m> is determined by <m>\sigma( \omega)</m>.  It must be the case that <m>\sigma( \omega ) = \omega^i</m> for some integer <m>i</m> since all of the zeros of <m>x^n - 1</m> are powers of <m>\omega</m>. If <m>\tau( \omega ) = \omega^j</m> is in <m>G(F(\omega)/F)</m>, then
						<me>\sigma \tau( \omega ) = \sigma( \omega^j ) = [ \sigma( \omega )]^j = \omega^{ij} = [\tau( \omega ) ]^i = \tau( \omega^i )  = \tau \sigma( \omega ).</me>
					Therefore, <m>G(F( \omega ) / F)</m> is abelian.  By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory the series 
						<me>\{ \identity \} \subset G(E/ F(\omega)) \subset G(E/F)</me>
					is a normal series. By our previous argument, <m>G(E/F(\omega))</m> is abelian.  Since
						<me>G(E/F) /G(E/F( \omega)) \cong G(F(\omega)/F)</me>
					is also abelian, <m>G(E/F)</m> is solvable.</p>

			<lemma xml:id="lemma-radical-extension">
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic zero and let
						<me>F = F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq F_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F_r = E</me>
					a radical extension of <m>F</m>. Then there exists a normal radical extension

<!-- Major rewrite of the proof. -->

<!-- Proof should be correct now. -->
<!-- TWJ - 6/5/2013 -->				
				<proof>
					<p>Since <m>E</m> is a radical extension of <m>F</m>,  there exists a chain of subfields
						<me>F = F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq F_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F_r = E</me>
					such for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, r</m>, we have  <m>F_i = F_{i - 1}(\alpha_i)</m> and <m>\alpha_i^{n_i} \in F_{i-1}</m> for some positive integer <m>n_i</m>.  We will build a normal radical extension of <m>F</m>,
						<me>F = K_0 \subseteq K_1 \subseteq K_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_r = K</me>
					such that <m>K \supseteq E</m>.  Define <m>K_1</m> for be the splitting field of <m>x^{n_1} - \alpha_1^{n_1}</m>.  The roots of this polynomial are <m>\alpha_1, \alpha_1 \omega, \alpha_1 \omega^2, \ldots, \alpha_1 \omega^{n_1 - 1}</m>, where <m>\omega</m> is a primitive  <m>n_1</m>th root of unity.  If <m>F</m> contains all of its <m>n_1</m> roots of unity, then  <m>K_1 = F(\alpha_!)</m>.   On the other hand, suppose that <m>F</m> does not contain a primitive <m>n_1</m>th root of unity.  If <m>\beta</m> is a root of  <m>x^{n_1} - \alpha_1^{n_1}</m>, then all of the roots of  <m>x^{n_1} - \alpha_1^{n_1}</m> must be <m>\beta, \omega \beta, \ldots, \omega^{n_1-1}</m>, where  <m>\omega</m> is a primitive  <m>n_1</m>th root of unity. In this case, <m>K_1 = F(\omega \beta)</m>.  Thus, <m>K_1</m> is a normal radical extension of <m>F</m> containing <m>F_1</m>. Continuing in this manner, we obtain
						<me>F = K_0 \subseteq K_1 \subseteq K_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_r = K</me>
					such that <m>K_i</m> is a normal extension of <m>K_{i-1}</m> and <m>K_i \supseteq F_i</m> for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, r</m>.</p>

			<p>We will now prove the main theorem about solvability by radicals.</p>
 
			<theorem xml:id="theorem-solvable-by-radicals">
				<statement>
					<p>Let <m>f(x)</m> be in <m>F[x]</m>, where <m>\chr F = 0</m>. If <m>f(x)</m> is solvable by radicals, then the Galois group of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m> is solvable.</p>

					<p>Since <m>f(x)</m> is solvable by radicals there exists an extension <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> by radicals <m>F = F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F_n = E</m>.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, <m>G(E/F_i)</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G(E/F_{i - 1})</m>.  Therefore, we have a subnormal series of subgroups of <m>G(E/F)</m>:

				<p>We will show that <m>f(x) = x^5 - 6 x^3 - 27 x - 3 \in {\mathbb Q}[x]</m> is not solvable. We claim that the Galois group of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is <m>S_5</m>. By Eisenstein's Criterion, <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible and, therefore, must be separable. The derivative of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>f'(x) = 5 x^4 - 18 x^2 - 27</m>; hence, setting <m>f'(x) = 0</m> and solving, we find that the only real roots of <m>f'(x)</m> are
					<me>x = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{6 \sqrt{6} + 9 }{5} }.</me>
				Therefore, <m>f(x)</m> can have at most one maximum and one minimum.  It is easy to show that <m>f(x)</m> changes sign between <m>-3</m> and <m>-2</m>, between <m>-2</m> and <m>0</m>, and once again between <m>0</m> and <m>4</m> (Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-galois-4" />). Therefore, <m>f(x)</m> has exactly three distinct real roots. The remaining two roots of <m>f(x)</m> must be complex conjugates. Let <m>K</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m>. Since <m>f(x)</m> has five distinct roots in <m>K</m> and every automorphism of <m>K</m> fixing <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is determined by the way it permutes the roots of <m>f(x)</m>, we know that <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q})</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_5</m>. Since <m>f</m> is irreducible, there is an element in <m>\sigma \in G(K/{\mathbb Q})</m> such that <m>\sigma(a) = b</m> for two roots <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of <m>f(x)</m>. The automorphism of <m>{\mathbb C}</m> that takes <m>a + bi \mapsto a - bi</m> leaves the real roots fixed and interchanges the complex roots; consequently, <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q} ) \subset S_5</m>. By Lemma<nbsp /><xref ref="lemma-sn-generating" />, <m>S_5</m> is generated by a transposition and an element of order 5; therefore, <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q} )</m> must be all of <m>S_5</m>. By Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-an-simple" />, <m>S_5</m> is not solvable. Consequently, <m>f(x)</m> cannot be solved by radicals.</p>

			<title>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
 
			<p>It seems fitting that the last theorem that we will state and prove is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. This theorem was first proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis.  Prior to Gauss's proof, mathematicians  suspected that there might exist polynomials over the real and complex  numbers having no solutions. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into distinct linear factors.</p>

			<theorem>
				<title>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
				<index><main>Fundamental Theorem</main><sub>of Algebra</sub></index>
				<statement>
					<p>The field of complex numbers is algebraically closed; that is, every polynomial in <m>{\mathbb C}[x]</m> has a root in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.</p>
				</statement>
<!--				<comment>
					<p>For our proof we shall assume two facts from calculus.  We need the results that every polynomial of odd degree over <m>{\mathbb R}</m> has a real root and that every positive real number has a square root.</p>
				</comment>-->
				<proof>
					<p>Suppose that <m>E</m> is a proper finite field extension of the complex  numbers. Since any finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a simple extension, there exists an <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>E = {\mathbb C}( \alpha )</m> with <m>\alpha</m> the root of an irreducible polynomial <m>f(x)</m> in <m>{\mathbb C}[x]</m>. The splitting field <m>L</m> of <m>f(x)</m> is a finite normal separable extension of <m>{\mathbb C}</m> that contains  <m>E</m>. We must show that it is impossible for <m>L</m> to be a proper extension of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.</p>
 
					<p>Suppose that <m>L</m> is a proper extension of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>. Since <m>L</m> is the splitting field of <m>f(x)(x^2 + 1)</m> over <m>{\mathbb R}</m>, <m>L</m> is a finite normal separable extension of <m>{\mathbb R}</m>. Let <m>K</m> be the fixed field of a Sylow 2-subgroup <m>G</m> of <m>G(L/{\mathbb R})</m>. Then <m>L \supset  K \supset {\mathbb R}</m> and <m>|G( L / K )| =[L:K]</m>. Since <m>[L : {\mathbb R}] = [L:K][K:{\mathbb R}]</m>, we know that <m>[K:{\mathbb R}]</m> must be odd. Consequently, <m>K = {\mathbb R}(\beta)</m> with <m>\beta</m> having a minimal polynomial <m>f(x)</m> of odd degree.  Therefore, <m>K = {\mathbb R}</m>.</p>
 
					<p>We now know that <m>G(L/{\mathbb R})</m> must be a 2-group. It follows that <m>G(L / {\mathbb C})</m> is a 2-group.  We have assumed that <m>L \neq {\mathbb C}</m>; therefore, <m>|G(L / {\mathbb C})| \geq 2</m>.  By the first Sylow Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there exists a subgroup <m>G</m> of <m>G(L/{\mathbb C})</m> of index 2 and a field <m>E</m> fixed elementwise by <m>G</m>. Then <m>[E:{\mathbb C}] = 2</m> and there exists an element <m>\gamma \in E</m> with minimal polynomial <m>x^2 + b x + c</m> in <m>{\mathbb C}[x]</m>.  This polynomial has roots <m>( - b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}\, ) / 2</m> that are in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>, since <m>b^2 - 4 c</m> is in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.  This is impossible; hence, <m>L = {\mathbb C}</m>.</p>
				</proof>
			</theorem>
 
			<p>Although our proof was strictly algebraic, we were forced to rely on results from calculus.  It is necessary to assume the completeness axiom from analysis to show that every polynomial of odd degree has a real root and that every positive real number has a square root.  It seems that there is no possible way to avoid this difficulty and formulate a purely algebraic argument.  It is somewhat amazing that there are several elegant proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that use complex analysis.  It is also interesting to note that we can obtain a proof of such an important theorem from two very different fields of mathematics.</p>
