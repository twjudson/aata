  <title>Galois Theory</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A classic problem of algebra is to find the solutions of a polynomial equation.
      The solution to the quadratic equation was known in antiquity.
      Italian mathematicians found general solutions to the general cubic and quartic equations in the sixteenth century;
      however, attempts to solve the general fifth-degree, or quintic,
      polynomial were repulsed for the next three hundred years.
      Certainly, equations such as
      <m>x^5 - 1 = 0</m> or <m>x^6 - x^3 - 6 = 0</m> could be solved,
      but no solution like the quadratic formula was found for the general quintic,
      <me>
        a x^5 + b x^4 +c x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f = 0
      </me>.
      Finally, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Ruffini and Abel both found quintics that could not be solved with any formula.
      It was Galois, however,
      who provided the full explanation by showing which polynomials could and could not be solved by formulas.
      He discovered the connection between groups and field extensions.
      Galois theory demonstrates the strong interdependence of group and field theory,
      and has had far-reaching implications beyond its original purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this chapter we will prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.
      This result will be used to establish the insolvability of the quintic and to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

    <title>Field Automorphisms</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Our first task is to establish a link between group theory and field theory by examining automorphisms of fields.
      </p>

      <proposition>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is a group under composition of functions.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            If <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are automorphisms of <m>F</m>,
            then so are <m>\sigma \tau</m> and <m>\sigma^{-1}</m>.
            The identity is certainly an automorphism;
            hence, the set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is indeed a group.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </proposition>

      <proposition>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>E</m> be a field extension of <m>F</m>.
            Then the set of all automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise is a group;
            that is, the set of all automorphisms <m>\sigma : E \rightarrow E</m> such that
            <m>\sigma( \alpha ) = \alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha \in F</m> is a group.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We need only show that the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise is a subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of <m>E</m>.
            Let <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> be two automorphisms of <m>E</m> such that <m>\sigma( \alpha ) = \alpha</m> and
            <m>\tau( \alpha ) = \alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha \in F</m>.
            Then <m>\sigma \tau( \alpha ) = \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m> and <m>\sigma^{-1}( \alpha ) = \alpha</m>.
            Since the identity fixes every element of <m>E</m>,
            the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that leave elements of <m>F</m> fixed is a subgroup of the entire group of automorphisms of <m>E</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </proposition>

      <p>
        Let <m>E</m> be a field extension of <m>F</m>.
        We will denote the full group of automorphisms of <m>E</m> by <m>\aut(E)</m>.
        We define the <term>Galois group</term><idx><h>Group</h><h>Galois</h></idx><idx><h>Galois group</h></idx>
        of <m>E</m> over <m>F</m> to be the group of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise; that is,
        <me>
          G(E/F) = \{ \sigma \in \aut(E) : \sigma(\alpha) = \alpha \text{ for all } \alpha \in F \}
        </me>.
        If <m>f(x)</m> is a polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> and <m>E</m> is the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m>,
        then we define the Galois group of <m>f(x)</m> to be <m>G(E/F)</m>.

      <example xml:id="galois-example-complex-conj">
        <p>
          Complex conjugation, defined by <m>\sigma : a + bi \mapsto a - bi</m>,
          is an automorphism of the complex numbers.
          Since
          <me>
            \sigma(a) = \sigma(a + 0i) = a - 0i = a
          </me>,
          the automorphism defined by complex conjugation must be in <m>G( {\mathbb C} / {\mathbb R} )</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="galois-example-q-sqrt5">
        <p>
          Consider the fields <m>{\mathbb Q} \subset {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{5}\, ) \subset {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m>.
          Then for <m>a, b \in {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{5}\, )</m>,
          <me>
            \sigma( a + b \sqrt{3}\, ) = a - b \sqrt{3}

          is an automorphism of <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m> leaving <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{5}\, )</m> fixed.
          Similarly,
          <me>
            \tau( a + b \sqrt{5}\, ) = a - b \sqrt{5}
          </me>
          is an automorphism of <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m> leaving <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m> fixed.
          The automorphism <m>\mu = \sigma \tau</m> moves both <m>\sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\sqrt{5}</m>.
          It will soon be clear that
          <m>\{ \identity, \sigma, \tau, \mu \}</m> is the Galois group of
          <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
          The following table shows that this group is isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m>.

          </me>
          We may also regard the field
          <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m> as a vector space over
          <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> that has basis <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{15}\, \}</m>.
          It is no coincidence that <m>|G( {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ) /{\mathbb Q})| = [{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ):{\mathbb Q})] = 4</m>.

          <p>
            Let <m>E</m> be a field extension of <m>F</m> and <m>f(x)</m> be a polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>.
            Then any automorphism in <m>G(E/F)</m> defines a permutation of the roots of <m>f(x)</m> that lie in <m>E</m>.

        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let

              f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n

            and suppose that <m>\alpha \in E</m> is a zero of <m>f(x)</m>.
            Then for <m>\sigma \in G(E/F)</m>,

            </md>
            therefore, <m>\sigma( \alpha )</m> is also a zero of <m>f(x)</m>.

        over <m>F</m> if they have the same minimal polynomial.
        For example,

            Applying <xref ref="galois-theorem-extension-order"/>, we find that <m>|G(E/F)| = k</m>.

          <p>
            To prove that <m>G(E/F)</m> is cyclic,
            we must find a generator for <m>G(E/F)</m>.
            Let <m>\sigma : E \rightarrow E</m> be defined by <m>\sigma(\alpha) = \alpha^{p^n}</m>.
            We claim that <m>\sigma</m> is the element in <m>G(E/F)</m> that we are seeking.
            We first need to show that <m>\sigma</m> is in <m>\aut(E)</m>.
            If <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are in <m>E</m>,
            <me>
              \sigma(\alpha + \beta) = (\alpha + \beta)^{p^n} = \alpha^{p^n} + \beta^{p^n} = \sigma(\alpha) + \sigma(\beta)
            </me>
            by <xref ref="finite-lemma-freshmans-dream"/>.
            Also, it is easy to show that <m>\sigma(\alpha \beta) = \sigma( \alpha ) \sigma( \beta )</m>.
            Since <m>\sigma</m> is a nonzero homomorphism of fields,
            it must be injective.
            It must also be onto, since <m>E</m> is a finite field.
            We know that <m>\sigma</m> must be in <m>G(E/F)</m>,
            since <m>F</m> is the splitting field of
            <m>x^{p^n} - x</m> over the base field of order <m>p</m>.
            This means that <m>\sigma</m> leaves every element in <m>F</m> fixed.
            Finally, we must show that the order of <m>\sigma</m> is <m>k</m>.
            By <xref ref="galois-theorem-extension-order"/>, we know that
            <me>
              \sigma^k( \alpha ) = \alpha^{p^{nk}} = \alpha^{p^m} = \alpha
            </me>
            is the identity of <m>G( E/F)</m>.
            However, <m>\sigma^r</m> cannot be the identity for <m>1 \leq r \lt k</m>;
            otherwise, <m>x^{p^{nr}} - x</m> would have <m>p^m</m> roots,
            which is impossible.

        Many of the results that we have just proven depend on the fact that a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m> has no repeated roots in its splitting field.
        It is evident that we need to know exactly when a polynomial factors into distinct linear factors in its splitting field.
        Let <m>E</m> be the splitting field of a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
        Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> factors over <m>E</m> as
        <me>
          f(x) = (x - \alpha_1)^{n_1} (x - \alpha_2)^{n_2} \cdots (x - \alpha_r)^{n_r} = \prod_{i = 1}^{r} (x - \alpha_i)^{n_i}

        We define the <term>multiplicity</term><idx><h>Multiplicity of a root</h></idx><idx><h>Zero</h><h>multiplicity of</h></idx>
        of a root <m>\alpha_i</m> of <m>f(x)</m> to be <m>n_i</m>.
        A root with multiplicity 1 is called a <idx><h>Simple root</h></idx><term>simple root</term>.

            Let <m>f(x)</m> be an irreducible polynomial over <m>F</m>.
            If the characteristic of <m>F</m> is <m>0</m>,

            First assume that <m>\chr F = 0</m>.
            Since <m>\deg f'(x) \lt \deg f(x)</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible,
            the only way <m>\gcd( f(x),

        Certainly extensions of a field <m>F</m> of the form
        <m>F(\alpha)</m> are some of the easiest to study and understand.
        Given a field extension <m>E</m> of <m>F</m>,
        the obvious question to ask is when it is possible to find an element
        <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>E = F( \alpha )</m>.

        We already know that primitive elements exist for certain extensions.

          {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[3]{5}, \sqrt{5}\, i ) = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[6]{5}\, i )
        </me>.
        <xref ref="finite-corollary-finite-extension-finite-field"/> tells us that there exists a primitive element for any finite extension of a finite field.
        The next theorem tells us that we can often find a primitive element.

        <proof>
          <p>
            We already know that there is no problem if <m>F</m> is a finite field.
            Suppose that <m>E</m> is a finite extension of an infinite field.
            We will prove the result for <m>F(\alpha, \beta)</m>.
            The general case easily follows when we use mathematical induction.
            Let <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> be  the minimal polynomials of <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>,
            respectively.
            Let <m>K</m> be the field in which both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> split.
            Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> has zeros
            <m>\alpha = \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n</m> in <m>K</m> and <m>g(x)</m> has zeros <m>\beta = \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_m</m> in <m>K</m>.
            All of these zeros have multiplicity <m>1</m>,
            since <m>E</m> is separable over <m>F</m>.
            Since <m>F</m> is infinite, we can find an <m>a</m> in <m>F</m> such that
            <me>
              a \neq \frac{\alpha_i - \alpha}{\beta - \beta_j}
            </me>
            for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> with <m>j \neq 1</m>.
            Therefore, <m>a( \beta - \beta_j ) \neq \alpha_i - \alpha</m>.
            Let <m>\gamma = \alpha + a \beta</m>.
            Then
            <me>
              \gamma = \alpha + a \beta \neq \alpha_i + a \beta_j;
            </me>
            hence, <m>\gamma - a \beta_j \neq \alpha_i</m> for all
            <m>i,
            j</m> with <m>j \neq 1</m>.
            Define <m>h(x) \in F( \gamma )[x]</m> by <m>h(x) = f( \gamma - ax)</m>.
            Then <m>h( \beta ) = f( \alpha ) = 0</m>.
            However, <m>h( \beta_j ) \neq 0</m> for <m>j \neq 1</m>.
            Hence, <m>h(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> have a single common factor in <m>F( \gamma )[x]</m>;
            that is, the minimal polynomial of <m>\beta</m> over <m>F( \gamma )</m> must be linear,
            since <m>\beta</m> is the only zero common to both <m>g(x)</m> and <m>h(x)</m>.
            So <m>\beta \in F( \gamma )</m> and
            <m>\alpha = \gamma - a \beta</m> is in <m>F( \gamma )</m>.
            Hence, <m>F( \alpha, \beta ) = F( \gamma )</m>.

            has more unknowns than equations.
            From linear algebra we know that this system has a nontrivial solution,
            say <m>x_i = a_i</m> for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, n + 1</m>.
            Since <m>\sigma_1</m> is the identity,
            the first equation translates to
            <me>
              a_1 \alpha_1 +  a_2 \alpha_2 + \cdots + a_{n + 1} \alpha_{n + 1} = 0
            </me>.
            The problem is that some of the <m>a_i</m>'s may be in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>.
            We must show that this is impossible.
          </p>
            <!-- Corrected typo.  Suggested by K. Brooks. - TWJ 6/15/2012 -->
          <p>
            Suppose that at least one of the <m>a_i</m>'s is in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>.
            By rearranging the <m>\alpha_i</m>'s we may assume that <m>a_1</m> is nonzero.
            Since any nonzero multiple of a solution is also a solution,
            we can also assume that <m>a_1 = 1</m>.
            Of all possible solutions fitting this description,
            we choose the one with the smallest number of nonzero terms.
            Again, by rearranging <m>\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{n + 1}</m> if necessary,
            we can assume that <m>a_2</m> is in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>.
            Since <m>F</m> is the subfield of <m>E</m> that is fixed elementwise by <m>G</m>,
            there exists a <m>\sigma_i</m> in <m>G</m> such that <m>\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2</m>.
            Applying <m>\sigma_i</m> to each equation in the system,
            we end up with the same homogeneous system,
            since <m>G</m> is a group.
            Therefore, <m>x_1 = \sigma_i(a_1) = 1</m>,
            <m>x_2 = \sigma_i(a_2)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
            <m>x_{n + 1} = \sigma_i(a_{n+1} )</m> is also a solution of the original system.
            We know that a linear combination of two solutions of a homogeneous system is also a solution;
            consequently,
            <md>
              <mrow>x_1 &amp; = 1 -1 = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>x_2 &amp; = a_2 - \sigma_i(a_2)</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; \vdots &amp;</mrow>
              <mrow>x_{n + 1} &amp; = a_{n + 1} - \sigma_i(a_{n + 1})</mrow>
            </md>
            must be another solution of the system.
            This is a nontrivial solution because <m>\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2</m>,
            and has fewer nonzero entries than our original solution.
            This is a contradiction,
            since the number of nonzero solutions to our original solution was assumed to be minimal.
            We can therefore conclude that <m>a_1, \ldots, a_{n + 1} \in F</m>.

        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            (1) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (2).
            Let <m>E</m> be a finite, normal,
            separable extension of <m>F</m>.
            By the Primitive Element Theorem,
            we can find an <m>\alpha</m> in <m>E</m> such that <m>E = F(\alpha)</m>.
            Let <m>f(x)</m> be the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m>.
            The field <m>E</m> must contain all of the roots of <m>f(x)</m> since it is a normal extension <m>F</m>;
            hence, <m>E</m> is a splitting field for <m>f(x)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            (2) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (3).
            Let <m>E</m> be the splitting field over <m>F</m> of a separable polynomial.
            By <xref ref="galois-proposition-fixed-field"/>, <m>E_{G(E/F)} = F</m>.
            Since <m>| G(E/F)| = [E:F]</m>, this is a finite group.
          </p>

          <p>
            (3) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (1).
            Let <m>F = E_G</m> for some finite group of automorphisms <m>G</m> of <m>E</m>.
            Since <m>[E:F] \leq |G|</m>, <m>E</m> is a finite extension of <m>F</m>.
            To show that <m>E</m> is a finite,
            normal extension of <m>F</m>,
            let <m>f(x) \in F[x]</m> be an irreducible monic polynomial that has a root <m>\alpha</m> in <m>E</m>.
            We must show that <m>f(x)</m> is the product of distinct linear factors in <m>E[x]</m>.
            By <xref ref="galois-proposition-roots-permute"/>,
            automorphisms in <m>G</m> permute the roots of <m>f(x)</m> lying in <m>E</m>.
            Hence, if we let <m>G</m> act on <m>\alpha</m>,
            we can obtain distinct roots <m>\alpha_1 = \alpha, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n</m> in <m>E</m>.
            Let <m>g(x) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} (x -\alpha_i)</m>.
            Then <m>g(x)</m> is separable over <m>F</m> and <m>g( \alpha ) = 0</m>.
            Any automorphism <m>\sigma</m> in <m>G</m> permutes the factors of <m>g(x)</m> since it permutes these roots;
            hence, when <m>\sigma</m> acts on <m>g(x)</m>,
            it must fix the coefficients of <m>g(x)</m>.
            Therefore, the coefficients of <m>g(x)</m> must be in <m>F</m>.
            Since <m>\deg g(x) \leq \deg f(x)</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>,
            <m>f(x) = g(x)</m>.

            Then <m>G = G(K/F)</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>F = K_G</m>, <m>G</m> is a subgroup of <m>G(K/F)</m>.

            then the following statements are true.

        <proof>
          <p>
            (1) Suppose that <m>G(E/K) = G(E/L) = G</m>.
            Both <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> are fixed fields of <m>G</m>;
            hence, <m>K=L</m> and the map defined by <m>K \mapsto G(E/K)</m> is one-to-one.
            To show that the map is onto,
            let <m>G</m> be a subgroup of <m>G(E/F)</m> and <m>K</m> be the field fixed by <m>G</m>.
            Then <m>F \subset K \subset E</m>;
            consequently, <m>E</m> is a normal extension of <m>K</m>.
            Thus, <m>G(E/K) = G</m> and the map <m>K \mapsto G(E/K)</m> is a bijection.
          </p>

          <p>
            (2) By Theorem <xref ref="galois-theorem-extension-order"/>, <m>|G(E/K)| = [E:K]</m>;
            therefore,
            <me>
              |G(E/F)| = [G(E/F):G(E/K)] \cdot |G(E/K)| = [E:F] = [E:K][K:F]

            Thus, <m>[K:F] = [G(E/F):G(E/K)]</m>.

          <p>
            Statement (3) is illustrated in <xref ref="galois-figure-2"/>.
            We leave the proof of this property as an exercise.
          </p>

          <p>
            (4) This part takes a little more work.
            Let <m>K</m> be a normal extension of <m>F</m>.
            If <m>\sigma</m> is in <m>G(E/F)</m> and <m>\tau</m> is in <m>G(E/K)</m>,
            we need to show that <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma</m> is in <m>G(E/K)</m>;
            that is, we need to show that
            <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha \in K</m>.
            Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m>.
            Then <m>\sigma( \alpha )</m> is also a root of <m>f(x)</m> lying in <m>K</m>,
            since <m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m>.
            Hence, <m>\tau( \sigma( \alpha )) = \sigma( \alpha )</m> or <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conversely, let <m>G(E/K)</m> be a normal subgroup of <m>G(E/F)</m>.
            We need to show that <m>F = K_{G(K/F)}</m>.
            Let <m>\tau \in G(E/K)</m>.
            For all <m>\sigma \in G(E/F)</m> there exists a
            <m>\overline{\tau} \in G(E/K)</m> such that <m>\tau \sigma = \sigma \overline{\tau}</m>.
            Consequently, for all <m>\alpha \in K</m>
            <me>
              \tau( \sigma( \alpha ) ) = \sigma( \overline{\tau}( \alpha ) ) = \sigma( \alpha );
            </me>
            hence, <m>\sigma( \alpha )</m> must be in the fixed field of <m>G(E/K)</m>.
            Let <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> be the restriction of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>.
            Then <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> is an automorphism of <m>K</m> fixing <m>F</m>,
            since <m>\sigma( \alpha ) \in K</m> for all <m>\alpha \in K</m>;
            hence, <m>\overline{\sigma} \in G(K/F)</m>.
            Next, we will show that the fixed field of <m>G(K/F)</m> is <m>F</m>.
            Let <m>\beta</m> be an element in <m>K</m> that is fixed by all automorphisms in <m>G(K/F)</m>.
            In particular,
            <m>\overline{\sigma}(\beta) = \beta</m> for all <m>\sigma \in G(E/F)</m>.
            Therefore, <m>\beta</m> belongs to the fixed field <m>F</m> of <m>G(E/F)</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, we must show that when <m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m>,
            <me>
              G(K/F) \cong G(E/F) / G(E/K)
            </me>.
            For <m>\sigma \in G(E/F)</m>,
            let <m>\sigma_K</m> be the automorphism of <m>K</m> obtained by restricting <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>.
            Since <m>K</m> is a normal extension,
            the argument in the preceding paragraph shows that <m>\sigma_K \in G( K/F)</m>.
            Consequently, we have a map
            <m>\phi:G(E/F) \rightarrow G(K/F)</m> defined by <m>\sigma \mapsto \sigma_K</m>.
            This map is a group homomorphism since
            <me>
              \phi( \sigma \tau ) = (\sigma \tau)_K = \sigma_K \tau_K  = \phi( \sigma) \phi( \tau )
            </me>.
            The kernel of <m>\phi</m> is <m>G(E/K)</m>.
            By (2),
            <me>
              |G(E/F)| / |G(E/K)| = [K:F] = |G(K/F)|
            </me>.
            Hence, the image of <m>\phi</m> is <m>G(K/F)</m> and <m>\phi</m> is onto.
            Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have
            <me>
              G(K/F) \cong G(E/F) / G( E/K )
            </me>.

          In this example we will illustrate the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory by determining the lattice of subgroups of the Galois group of <m>f(x) = x^4 - 2</m>.
          We will compare this lattice to the lattice of field extensions of

          it must be the case that <m>[ {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[4]{2}, i ): {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}\, )] = 2</m>.

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p>
        Solutions for the cubic and quartic equations were discovered in the 1500s.
        Attempts to find solutions for the quintic equations puzzled some of history's best mathematicians.
        In 1798, P. Ruffini<idx><h>Ruffini, P.</h></idx>
        submitted a paper that claimed no such solution could be found;
        however, the paper was not well received.
        In 1826, Niels Henrik Abel<idx><h>Abel, Niels Henrik</h></idx>
        (1802<ndash/>1829) finally offered the first correct proof that quintics are not always solvable by radicals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Abel inspired the work of Évariste Galois.<idx><h>Galois, Évariste</h></idx>
        Born in 1811, Galois began to display extraordinary mathematical talent at the age of 14.
        He applied for entrance to the École Polytechnique several times;
        however, he had great difficulty meeting the formal entrance requirements,
        and the examiners failed to recognize his mathematical genius.
        He was finally accepted at the École Normale in 1829.
      </p>

      <p>
        Galois worked to develop a theory of solvability for polynomials.
        In 1829, at the age of 17, Galois presented two papers on the solution of algebraic equations to the Académie des Sciences de Paris.
        These papers were sent to Cauchy,
        who subsequently lost them.
        A third paper was submitted to Fourier,
        who died before he could read the paper.
        Another paper was presented, but was not published until 1846.
      </p>

      <p>
        Galois' democratic sympathies led him into the Revolution of 1830.
        He was expelled from school and sent to prison for his part in the turmoil.
        After his release in 1832,
        he was drawn into a duel possibly over a love affair.
        Certain that he would be killed,
        he spent the evening before his death outlining his work and his basic ideas for research in a long letter to his friend Chevalier.
        He was indeed dead the next day, at the age of 20.

            <!-- Major clean up of the section -->
            <!-- TWJ 3/5/2013 -->
      <p>
        Throughout this section we shall assume that all fields have characteristic zero to ensure that irreducible polynomials do not have multiple roots.
        The immediate goal of this section is to determine when the roots of a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> can be computed with a finite number of operations on the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m>.
        The allowable operations are addition, subtraction,
        multiplication, division, and the extraction of <m>n</m>th roots.
        Certainly the solution to the quadratic equation,
        <m>a x^2 + b x +c = 0</m>, illustrates this process:
        <me>
          x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
        </me>.
        The only one of these operations that might demand a larger field is the taking of <m>n</m>th roots.
        We are led to the following definition.
      </p>

      <p>
        An extension field <m>E</m> of a field <m>F</m> is an
        <term>extension by radicals</term><idx><h>Extension</h><h>radical</h></idx>
        if there exists a chain of subfields
        <me>
          F = F_0 \subset F_1 \subset F_2 \subset \cdots \subset F_r = E
        </me>
        such for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, r</m>,
        we have  <m>F_i = F_{i - 1}(\alpha_i)</m> and
        <m>\alpha_i^{n_i} \in F_{i-1}</m> for some positive integer <m>n_i</m>.
        A polynomial <m>f(x)</m> is <term>solvable by radicals</term><idx><h>Solvability by radicals</h></idx>
        over <m>F</m> if the splitting field <m>K</m> of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m> is contained in an extension of <m>F</m> by radicals.
        Our goal is to arrive at criteria that will tell us whether or not a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> is solvable by radicals by examining the Galois group <m>f(x)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The easiest polynomial to solve by radicals is one of the form <m>x^n - a</m>.
        As we discussed in <xref ref="cyclic"/>,
        the roots of <m>x^n - 1</m> are called the
        <idx><h><m>n</m>th root of unity</h></idx><term>nth roots of unity</term>.
        These roots are a finite subgroup of the splitting field of <m>x^n -1</m>.
        By <xref ref="finite-corollary-cyclic-group-finite-field"/>, the <m>n</m>th roots of unity form a cyclic group.
        Any generator of this group is called a
        <idx><h>Primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity</h></idx><term>primitive nth root of unity</term>.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="galois-example-group-xn-1">
        <p>
          The polynomial <m>x^n - 1</m> is solvable by radicals over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
          The roots of this polynomial are <m>1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{n - 1}</m>, where
          <me>
            \omega = \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi}{n} \right) + i \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi}{n} \right)

          The splitting field of <m>x^n - 1</m> over
          <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is <m>{\mathbb Q}(\omega)</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <p>
        We shall prove that a polynomial is solvable by radicals if its Galois group is solvable.
        Recall that a subnormal series of a group <m>G</m> is a finite sequence of subgroups
        <me>
          G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}

        where <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m>.
        A group <m>G</m> is solvable  if it has a subnormal series
        <m>\{ H_i \}</m> such that all of the factor groups <m>H_{i+1} /H_i</m> are abelian.
        For example,
        if we examine the series <m>\{ \identity \} \subset A_3 \subset S_3</m>,
        we see that <m>S_3</m> is solvable.
        On the other hand, <m>S_5</m> is not solvable,

        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field of characteristic zero and <m>E</m> be the splitting field of <m>x^n - a</m> over <m>F</m> with <m>a \in F</m>.
            Then <m>G(E/F)</m> is a solvable group.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            The roots of <m>x^n - a</m> are <m>\sqrt[n]{a}, \omega \sqrt[n]{a}, \ldots, \omega^{n-1} \sqrt[n]{a}</m>,
            where <m>\omega</m> is a primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity.
            Suppose that <m>F</m> contains all of its <m>n</m>th roots of unity.
            If <m>\zeta</m> is one of the roots of  <m>x^n - a</m>,
            then distinct roots of <m>x^n - a</m> are
            <m>\zeta, \omega \zeta, \ldots, \omega^{n - 1} \zeta</m>,
            and <m>E = F(\zeta)</m>.
            Since <m>G(E/F)</m> permutes the roots <m>x^n - a</m>,
            the elements in  <m>G(E/F)</m> must be determined by their action on these roots.
            Let <m>\sigma</m>  and <m>\tau</m> be in <m>G(E/F)</m> and suppose that
            <m>\sigma( \zeta ) = \omega^i \zeta</m> and <m>\tau( \zeta ) = \omega^j \zeta</m>.
            If <m>F</m> contains the roots of unity, then

              \sigma \tau( \zeta ) = \sigma( \omega^j \zeta) = \omega^j \sigma( \zeta ) = \omega^{i+j} \zeta = \omega^i \tau( \zeta ) = \tau( \omega^i \zeta ) = \tau \sigma( \zeta )
            </me>.
            Therefore, <m>\sigma \tau = \tau \sigma</m> and <m>G(E/F)</m> is abelian, and
            <m>G(E/F)</m> must be solvable.

            <!-- TWJ - 5/3/2013 -->
          <p>
            Now suppose that <m>F</m> does not contain a primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity.
            Let <m>\omega</m> be a generator of the cyclic group of the <m>n</m>th roots of unity.
            Let <m>\alpha</m> be a zero of <m>x^n - a</m>.
            Since <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\omega \alpha</m> are both in the splitting field of <m>x^n - a</m>,
            <m>\omega = (\omega \alpha)/ \alpha</m> is also in <m>E</m>.
            Let <m>K = F( \omega)</m>.
            Then <m>F \subset K \subset E</m>.
            Since <m>K</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^n - 1</m>,
            <m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m>.
            Therefore, any automorphism <m>\sigma</m> in
            <m>G(F( \omega)/ F)</m> is determined by <m>\sigma( \omega)</m>.
            It must be the case that <m>\sigma( \omega ) = \omega^i</m> for some integer <m>i</m> since all of the zeros of <m>x^n - 1</m> are powers of <m>\omega</m>.
            If <m>\tau( \omega ) = \omega^j</m> is in <m>G(F(\omega)/F)</m>, then
            <me>
              \sigma \tau( \omega ) = \sigma( \omega^j ) = [ \sigma( \omega )]^j = \omega^{ij} = [\tau( \omega ) ]^i = \tau( \omega^i )  = \tau \sigma( \omega )
            </me>.
            Therefore, <m>G(F( \omega ) / F)</m> is abelian.
            By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory the series
            <me>
              \{ \identity \} \subset G(E/ F(\omega)) \subset G(E/F)
            </me>
            is a normal series.
            By our previous argument, <m>G(E/F(\omega))</m> is abelian.
            Since
            <me>
              G(E/F) /G(E/F( \omega)) \cong G(F(\omega)/F)
            </me>
            is also abelian, <m>G(E/F)</m> is solvable.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>E</m> is a radical extension of <m>F</m>,
            there exists a chain of subfields
            <me>
              F = F_0 \subset F_1 \subset F_2 \subset \cdots \subset F_r = E
            </me>
            such for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, r</m>,
            we have  <m>F_i = F_{i - 1}(\alpha_i)</m> and
            <m>\alpha_i^{n_i} \in F_{i-1}</m> for some positive integer <m>n_i</m>.
            We will build a normal radical extension of <m>F</m>,
            <me>
              F = K_0 \subset K_1 \subset K_2 \subset \cdots \subset K_r = K
            </me>
            such that <m>K \supseteq E</m>.
            Define <m>K_1</m> for be the splitting field of <m>x^{n_1} - \alpha_1^{n_1}</m>.
            The roots of this polynomial are <m>\alpha_1, \alpha_1 \omega, \alpha_1 \omega^2, \ldots, \alpha_1 \omega^{n_1 - 1}</m>,
            where <m>\omega</m> is a primitive <m>n_1</m>th root of unity.
            If <m>F</m> contains all of its <m>n_1</m> roots of unity,
            then <m>K_1 = F(\alpha_1)</m>.
            On the other hand,
            suppose that <m>F</m> does not contain a primitive <m>n_1</m>th root of unity.
            If <m>\beta</m> is a root of <m>x^{n_1} - \alpha_1^{n_1}</m>,
            then all of the roots of  <m>x^{n_1} - \alpha_1^{n_1}</m> must be <m>\beta, \omega \beta, \ldots, \omega^{n_1-1} \beta</m>,
            where  <m>\omega</m> is a primitive  <m>n_1</m>th root of unity.
            In this case, <m>K_1 = F(\omega \beta)</m>.
            Thus, <m>K_1</m> is a normal radical extension of <m>F</m> containing <m>F_1</m>.
            Continuing in this manner, we obtain
            <me>
              F = K_0 \subset K_1 \subset K_2 \subset \cdots \subset K_r = K
            </me>
            such that <m>K_i</m> is a normal extension of <m>K_{i-1}</m> and
            <m>K_i \supseteq F_i</m> for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, r</m>.

        We will now prove the main theorem about solvability by radicals.

      <theorem xml:id="galois-theorem-solvable-by-radicals">

            If <m>f(x)</m> is solvable by radicals,
            then the Galois group of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m> is solvable.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Since <m>f(x)</m> is solvable by radicals there exists an extension <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> by radicals <m>F = F_0 \subset F_1 \subset \cdots \subset F_n = E</m>.
            By  <xref ref="galois-lemma-radical-extension"/>,
            we can assume that <m>E</m> is a splitting field <m>f(x)</m> and <m>F_i</m> is normal over <m>F_{i - 1}</m>.
            By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory,
            <m>G(E/F_i)</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G(E/F_{i - 1})</m>.
            Therefore, we have a subnormal series of subgroups of <m>G(E/F)</m>:
            <me>
              \{ \identity \} \subset G(E/F_{n - 1}) \subset \cdots \subset G(E/F_1) \subset G(E/F)
            </me>.
            Again by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, we know that
            <me>
              G(E/F_{i - 1})/G(E/F_i) \cong G(F_i/F_{i - 1})
            </me>.
            By <xref ref="galois-lemma-xn-a-solvable"/>, <m>G(F_i/F_{i - 1})</m> is solvable;
            hence, <m>G(E/F)</m> is also solvable.

          </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a subgroup of <m>S_p</m> that contains a transposition <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> a cycle of length <m>p</m>.

            The order of <m>\tau</m> is <m>p</m> and <m>\tau^n</m> must be a cycle of length <m>p</m> for <m>1 \leq n \lt p</m>.

            (see <xref ref="permute-exercise-order-product-cycles"/> in <xref ref="permute"/>).
            Noting that <m>(1 \, 2)(1, 2, i_3,\ldots, i_p) = (2, i_3, \ldots, i_p)</m> and <m>(2,i_3, \ldots, i_p)^k(1 \, 2)(2,i_3, \ldots, i_p)^{-k} = (1 \, i_k)</m>,
            we can obtain all the transpositions of the form <m>(1n)</m> for <m>1 \leq n \lt p</m>.
            However, these transpositions generate all transpositions in <m>S_p</m>,

          We will show that <m>f(x) = x^5 - 6 x^3 - 27 x - 3 \in {\mathbb Q}[x]</m> is not solvable.
          We claim that the Galois group of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is <m>S_5</m>.
          By Eisenstein's Criterion,
          <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible and,
          therefore, must be separable.
          The derivative of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>f'(x) = 5 x^4 - 18 x^2 - 27</m>;
          hence, setting <m>f'(x) = 0</m> and solving,
          we find that the only real roots of <m>f'(x)</m> are
          <me>
            x = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{6 \sqrt{6} + 9 }{5} }
          </me>.
          Therefore, <m>f(x)</m> can have at most one maximum and one minimum.
          It is easy to show that <m>f(x)</m> changes sign between <m>-3</m> and <m>-2</m>,
          between <m>-2</m> and <m>0</m>,
          and once again between <m>0</m> and <m>4</m> (<xref ref="galois-figure-4"/>).
          Therefore, <m>f(x)</m> has exactly three distinct real roots.
          The remaining two roots of <m>f(x)</m> must be complex conjugates.
          Let <m>K</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m>.
          Since <m>f(x)</m> has five distinct roots in <m>K</m> and every automorphism of <m>K</m> fixing
          <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is determined by the way it permutes the roots of <m>f(x)</m>,
          we know that <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q})</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_5</m>.
          Since <m>f</m> is irreducible,
          there is an element in <m>\sigma \in G(K/{\mathbb Q})</m> such that
          <m>\sigma(a) = b</m> for two roots <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of <m>f(x)</m>.
          The automorphism of <m>{\mathbb C}</m> that takes
          <m>a + bi \mapsto a - bi</m> leaves the real roots fixed and interchanges the complex roots;
          consequently, <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q} )</m> contains a transposition.
          If <m>\alpha</m> is one of the real roots of <m>f(x)</m>,
          then <m>[\mathbb Q(\alpha) : \mathbb Q] = 5</m> by <xref ref="fields-exercise-degree-irred-poly"/>.
          Since <m>\mathbb Q(\alpha)</m> is a subfield of <m>K</m>,
          it must be the case that <m>[K : \mathbb Q]</m> is divisible by 5.
          Since <m>[K : \mathbb Q] = |G(K/{\mathbb Q})|</m> and <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q}) \subset S_5</m>,
          we know that <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q})</m> contains a cycle of length <m>5</m>.
          By <xref ref="galois-lemma-sn-generating"/>,
          <m>S_5</m> is generated by a transposition and an element of order <m>5</m>;
          therefore, <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q} )</m> must be all of <m>S_5</m>.
          By <xref ref="normal-theorem-an-simple"/>, <m>S_5</m> is not solvable.
          Consequently, <m>f(x)</m> cannot be solved by radicals.

      <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
      <p>
        It seems fitting that the last theorem that we will state and prove is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
        This theorem was first proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis.
        Prior to Gauss's proof,
        mathematicians suspected that there might exist polynomials over the real and complex numbers having no solutions.
        The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into distinct linear factors.

					<p>For our proof we shall assume two facts from calculus.  We need the results that every polynomial of odd degree over <m>{\mathbb R}</m> has a real root and that every positive real number has a square root.</p>
				</comment>-->
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>E</m> is a proper finite field extension of the complex numbers.
            Since any finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a simple extension,
            there exists an <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that
            <m>E = {\mathbb C}( \alpha )</m> with <m>\alpha</m> the root of an irreducible polynomial <m>f(x)</m> in <m>{\mathbb C}[x]</m>.
            The splitting field <m>L</m> of <m>f(x)</m> is a finite normal separable extension of
            <m>{\mathbb C}</m> that contains <m>E</m>.
            We must show that it is impossible for <m>L</m> to be a proper extension of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose that <m>L</m> is a proper extension of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
            Since <m>L</m> is the splitting field of
            <m>f(x) = (x^2 + 1)</m> over <m>{\mathbb R}</m>,
            <m>L</m> is a finite normal separable extension of <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
            Let <m>K</m> be the fixed field of a Sylow 2-subgroup <m>G</m> of <m>G(L/{\mathbb R})</m>.
            Then <m>L \supset K \supset {\mathbb R}</m> and <m>|G( L / K )| =[L:K]</m>.
            Since <m>[L : {\mathbb R}] = [L:K][K:{\mathbb R}]</m>,
            we know that <m>[K:{\mathbb R}]</m> must be odd.
            Consequently,
            <m>K = {\mathbb R}(\beta)</m> with <m>\beta</m> having a minimal polynomial <m>f(x)</m> of odd degree.
            Therefore, <m>K = {\mathbb R}</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We now know that <m>G(L/{\mathbb R})</m> must be a 2-group.
            It follows that <m>G(L / {\mathbb C})</m> is a <m>2</m>-group.
            We have assumed that <m>L \neq {\mathbb C}</m>;
            therefore, <m>|G(L / {\mathbb C})| \geq 2</m>.
            By the first Sylow Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory,
            there exists a subgroup <m>G</m> of
            <m>G(L/{\mathbb C})</m> of index 2 and a field <m>E</m> fixed elementwise by <m>G</m>.
            Then <m>[E:{\mathbb C}] = 2</m> and there exists an element
            <m>\gamma \in E</m> with minimal polynomial
            <m>x^2 + b x + c</m> in <m>{\mathbb C}[x]</m>.
            This polynomial has roots <m>( - b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}\, ) / 2</m> that are in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>,
            since <m>b^2 - 4 c</m> is in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
            This is impossible; hence, <m>L = {\mathbb C}</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>

      <p>
        Although our proof was strictly algebraic,
        we were forced to rely on results from calculus.
        It is necessary to assume the completeness axiom from analysis to show that every polynomial of odd degree has a real root and that every positive real number has a square root.
        It seems that there is no possible way to avoid this difficulty and formulate a purely algebraic argument.
        It is somewhat amazing that there are several elegant proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that use complex analysis.
        It is also interesting to note that we can obtain a proof of such an important theorem from two very different fields of mathematics.

    <title>Sage</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Again, our competence at examining fields with Sage will allow us to study the main concepts of Galois Theory easily.
        We will thoroughly examine Example 7 carefully using our computational tools.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection>
      <title>Galois Groups</title>
      <p>
        We will repeat <xref ref="galois-example-x4-2"/> and analyze carefully the splitting field of the polynomial <m>p(x)=x^4-2</m>.
        We begin with an initial field extension containing at least one root.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
        N.&lt;a&gt; = NumberField(x^4 - 2); N
        </input>
                <output>
        Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^4 - 2
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        The <c>.galois_closure()</c> method will create an extension containing all of the roots of the defining polynomial of a number field.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        L.&lt;b&gt; = N.galois_closure(); L
        </input>
                <output>
        Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^8 + 28*x^4 + 2500
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        L.degree()
        </input>
                <output>
        8
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        y = polygen(L, 'y')
        (y^4 - 2).factor()
        </input>
                <output>
        (y - 1/120*b^5 -  19/60*b) *
        (y - 1/240*b^5 + 41/120*b) *
        (y + 1/240*b^5 - 41/120*b) *
        (y + 1/120*b^5 +  19/60*b)
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        From the factorization,
        it is clear that <c>L</c> is the splitting field of the polynomial,
        even if the factorization is not pretty.
        It is easy to then obtain the Galois group of this field extension.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        G = L.galois_group(); G
        </input>
                <output>
        Galois group 8T4 ([4]2) with order 8 of x^8 + 28*x^4 + 2500
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        We can examine this group, and identify it.
        Notice that since the field is a degree <m>8</m> extension,
        the group is described as a permutation group on <m>8</m> symbols.
        (It is just a coincidence that the group has <m>8</m> elements.)
        With a paucity of nonabelian groups of order <m>8</m>,
        it is not hard to guess the nature of the group.
      </p>

                <output>
        True
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        That's it.
        But maybe not very satisfying.
        Let us dig deeper for more understanding.
        We will start over and create the splitting field of <m>p(x)=x^4-2</m> again,
        but the primary difference is that we will make the roots extremely obvious so we can work more carefully with the Galois group and the fixed fields.
        Along the way,
        we will see another example of linear algebra enabling certain computations.
        The following construction should be familiar by now.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
        p = x^4 - 2
        N.&lt;a&gt; = NumberField(p); N
        </input>
                <output>
        Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^4 - 2
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        y = polygen(N, 'y')
        p = p.subs(x=y)
        p.factor()
        </input>
                <output>
        (y - a) * (y + a) * (y^2 + a^2)
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        M.&lt;b&gt; = NumberField(y^2 + a^2); M
        </input>
                <output>
        Number Field in b with defining polynomial y^2 + a^2 over
        its base field
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        z = polygen(M, 'z')
        (z^4 - 2).factor()
        </input>
                <output>
        (z - b) * (z - a) * (z + a) * (z + b)
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        The important thing to notice here is that we have arranged the splitting field so that the four roots,
        <c>a, -a, b, -b</c>, are very simple functions of the generators.
        In more traditional notation,
        <c>a</c> is <m>2^{\frac{1}{4}}=\sqrt[4]{2}</m>,
        and <c>b</c> is <m>2^{\frac{1}{4}}i=\sqrt[4]{2}i</m>
        (or their negatives).
      </p>

      <p>
        We will find it easier to compute in the flattened tower,
        a now familiar construction.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        L.&lt;c&gt; = M.absolute_field(); L
        </input>
                <output>
        Number Field in c with defining polynomial x^8 + 28*x^4 + 2500
        </output>

                <input>
        fromL, toL = L.structure()
        </input>
            </sage>

      <p>
        We can return to our original polynomial
        (over the rationals),
        and ask for its roots in the flattened tower,
        custom-designed to contain these roots.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        roots = p.roots(ring=L, multiplicities=False); roots
        </input>
                <output>
        [1/120*c^5 +  19/60*c,
         1/240*c^5 - 41/120*c,
        -1/240*c^5 + 41/120*c,
        -1/120*c^5 -  19/60*c]
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Hmmm.
        Do those look right?
        If you look back at the factorization obtained in the field constructed with the <c>.galois_closure()</c> method,
        then they look right.
        But we can do better.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        [fromL(r) for r in roots]
        </input>
                <output>
        [b, a, -a, -b]
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Yes, those are the roots.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <c>End()</c> command will create the group of automorphisms of the field <c>L</c>.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        G = End(L); G
        </input>
                <output>
        Automorphism group of Number Field in c with
        defining polynomial x^8 + 28*x^4 + 2500
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        We can check that each of these automorphisms fixes the rational numbers elementwise.
        If a field homomorphism fixes 1, then it will fix the integers,
        and thus fix all fractions of integers.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        [tau(1) for tau in G]
        </input>
                <output>
        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        So each element of <c>G</c> fixes the rationals elementwise and thus <c>G</c> is the Galois group of the splitting field <c>L</c> over the rationals.
      </p>

      <p>
        <xref ref="galois-proposition-roots-permute"/> is fundamental.
        It says every automorphism in the Galois group of a field extension creates a permutation of the roots of a polynomial with coefficients in the base field.
        We have all of those ingredients here.
        So we will evaluate each automorphism of the Galois group at each of the four roots of our polynomial,
        which in each case should be another root. (We use the <c>Sequence()</c> constructor just to get nicely-aligned output.)
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        Sequence([[fromL(tau(r)) for r in roots] for tau in G], cr=True)
        </input>
                <output>
        [
        [b, a, -a, -b],
        [-b, -a, a, b],
        [a, -b, b, -a],
        [b, -a, a, -b],
        [-a, -b, b, a],
        [a, b, -b, -a],
        [-b, a, -a, b],
        [-a, b, -b, a]
        ]
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Each row of the output is a list of the roots, but permuted,
        and so corresponds to a permutation of four objects
        (the roots).
        For example,
        the second row shows the second automorphism interchanging <c>a</c> with <c>-a</c>,
        and <c>b</c> with <c>-b</c>.
        (Notice that the first row is the result of the identity automorphism,
        so we can mentally comine the first row with any other row to imagine a
        <q>two-row</q> form of a permutation.)
        We can number the roots, 1 through 4, and create each permutation as an element of <m>S_4</m>.
        It is overkill,
        but we can then build the permutation group by letting <em>all</em>
        of these elements generate a group.

      <title>Fixed Fields</title>
      <p>
        In a previous Sage exercise,
        we computed the fixed fields of single field automorphisms for finite fields.
        This was <q>easy</q> in the sense that we could just test every element of the field to see if it was fixed,
        since the field was finite.
        Now we have an infinite field extension.
        How are we going to determine which elements are fixed by individual automorphisms,
        or subgroups of automorphisms?
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer is to use the vector space structure of the flattened tower.
        As a degree <m>8</m> extension of the rationals,
        the first <m>8</m> powers of the primitive element <c>c</c> form a basis when the field is viewed as a vector space with the rationals as the scalars.
        It is sufficient to know how each field automorphism behaves on this basis to fully specify the definition of the automorphism.
        To wit,
        <md>
          <mrow>\tau(x)&amp;=\tau\left(\sum_{i=0}^7\,q_ic^i\right)&amp;&amp;q_i\in{\mathbb Q}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp;=\sum_{i=0}^7\,\tau(q_i)\tau(c^i)&amp;&amp;\tau\text{ is a field automorphism}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp;=\sum_{i=0}^7\,q_i\tau(c^i)&amp;&amp;\text{rationals are fixed}</mrow>
        </md>
        So we can compute the value of a field automorphism at any linear combination of powers of the primitive element as a linear combination of the values of the field automorphism at just the powers of the primitive element.
        This is known as the <q>power basis</q>,
        which we can obtain simply with the <c>.power_basis()</c> method.
        We will begin with an example of how we can use this basis.
        We will illustrate with the fourth automorphism of the Galois group.
        Notice that the <c>.vector()</c> method is a convenience that strips a linear combination of the powers of <c>c</c> into a vector of just the coefficients.  (Notice too that <m>\tau</m> is totally defined by the value of <m>\tau(c)</m>,
        since as a field automorphism <m>\tau(c^k)=(\tau(c))^k</m>.
        However, we still need to work with the entire power basis to exploit the vector space structure.)

        The last line expresses the fact that <c>tau_matrix</c> is a matrix representation of the field automorphism,
        viewed as a linear transformation of the vector space structure.
        As a representation of an invertible field homomorphism,
        the matrix is invertible.
        As an order <m>2</m> permutation of the roots,
        the inverse of the matrix is itself.
        But these facts are just verifications that we have the right thing,
        we are interested in other properties.

      <p>
        To construct fixed fields, we want to find elements fixed by automorphisms.
        Continuing with <c>tau</c> from above, we seek elements <c>z</c>
        (written as vectors)
        such that <c>tau_matrix*z=z</c>.
        These are eigenvectors for the eigenvalue <m>1</m>,

        Any element fixed by <c>tau</c> will be a linear combination of these four elements.
        We can ignore any rational multiples present,
        the first element is just saying the rationals are fixed,
        and the last element is just a product of the middle two.
        So fundamentally <c>tau</c> is fixing rationals, <c>b</c>
        (which is <m>\sqrt[4]{2}i</m>)
        and <c>a^2</c>
        (which is <m>\sqrt{2}</m>).
        Furthermore, <c>b^2 = -a^2</c>
        (the check follows),
        so we can create any fixed element of <c>tau</c> by just adjoining <c>b</c>=<m>\sqrt[4]{2}i</m> to the rationals.
        So the elements fixed by <c>tau</c> are <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}i)</m>.

        isomorphic to a subfield of <c>L</c>.
        The second item is an injective mapping from the new number field into <c>L</c>.
        In this case,
        the image of the primitive element <c>c0</c> is the element we have specified as the generator of the subfield.
        The primitive element of the new field will satisfy the defining polynomial <m>x^4+8</m> <mdash/> you can check that
        <m>(1-i)\sqrt[4]{2}</m> is indeed a root of the polynomial <m>x^4 + 8</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are five subgroups of order <m>2</m>,
        we have found fixed fields for two of them.
        The other three are similar,
        so it would be a good exercise to work through them.
        Our automorphism group has three subgroups of order 4, and at least one of each possible type
        (cyclic versus non-cyclic).
        Fixed fields of larger subgroups require that we find elements fixed by all of the automorphisms in the subgroup.
        (We were conveniently ignoring the identity automorphism above.)
        This will require more computation,
        but will restrict the possibilities
        (smaller fields)
        to where it will be easier to deduce a primitive element for each field.
      </p>

      <p>
        The seventh subgroup is generated by two elements of order <m>2</m> and is composed entirely of elements of order <m>2</m>
        (except the identity),
        so is isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
        The permutations correspond to automorphisms number 0, 1, 3, and 6.
        To determine the elements fixed by
        <em>all four</em> automorphisms,
        we will build the kernel for each one and as we go,
        we form the <em>intersection</em> of all four kernels.
        We will work via a loop over the four automorphisms.

        Since rationals are fixed,

        Mathematically, this is <m>2i</m>,

        Ten subfields are described,
        which is what we would expect,
        given the 10 subgroups of the Galois group.
        Each begins with a new number field that is a subfield.
        Technically, each is not a subset of <c>L</c>,
        but the second item returned for each subfield is an injective homomorphism,
        also known generally as an <q>embedding.</q>
        Each embedding describes how a primitive element of the subfield translates to an element of <c>L</c>.
        Some of these primitive elements could be manipulated
        (as we have done above)
        to yield slightly simpler minimal polynomials,
        but the results are quite impressive nonetheless.
        Each item in the list has a third component,
        which is almost always <c>None</c>,
        except when the subfield is the whole field,
        and then the third component is an injective homomorphism
        <q>in the other direction.</q>

          The polynomial <m>x^5-x-1</m> has all of the symmetric group <m>S_5</m> as its Galois group.
          Because <m>S_5</m> is not solvable,
          we know this polynomial to be an example of a quintic polynomial that is not solvable by radicals.
          Unfortunately,
          asking Sage to compute this Galois group takes far too long.
          So this exercise will simulate that experience with a slightly smaller example.

              Build the splitting field of <m>p(x)</m> one root at a time.
              Create an extension, factor there, discard linear factors,
              use the remaining irreducible factor to extend once more.
              Repeat until <m>p(x)</m> factors completely.
              Be sure to do a final extension via just a linear factor.
              This is a little silly, and Sage will seem to ignore your final generator
              (so you will want to setermine what it is equivalent to in terms of the previous gfenerators).
              Directions below depend on taking this extra step.

              Factor the original polynomial over the final extension field in the tower.
              What is boring about this factorization in comparison to some other examples we have done?

              From the degree of this extension and the degree of the original polynomial,
              infer the Galois group of the polynomial.

              Using the mappings that allow you to translate between the tower and the absolute field (obtained from the <c>.structure()</c> method),
              choose one of the roots
              (any one)
              and express it in terms of the single generator of the absolute field.
              Then reverse the procedure and express the single generator of the absolute field in terms of the roots in the tower.

          <li>
            <p>
              Compute the group of automorphisms of the absolute field
              (but don't display the whole group in what you submit).
              Take all four roots
              (including your silly one from the last step of the tower construction)
              and apply each field automorphism to the four roots

              Comment on what you see.

              There is one nontrivial automorphism that has an especially simple form

              Consider the extension of <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> formed by adjoining just one of the roots.
              This is a subfield of the splitting field of the polynomial,
              so is the fixed field of a subgroup of the Galois group.
              Give a simple description of the corresponding subgroup using language we typically only apply to permutation groups.

    <exercise number="4" xml:id="galois-sage-exercise-quintic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Return to the splitting field of the quintic discussed in the introduction to the previous problem
          (<m>x^5-x-1</m>).
          Create the first two intermediate fields by adjoining two roots
          (one at a time).
          But instead of factoring at each step to get a new irreducible polynomial,
          <em>divide</em> by the linear factor you
          <em>know</em> is a factor.
          In general, the quotient might factor further,
          but in this exercise presume it does not.
          In other words,
          act as if your quotient by the linear factor is irreducible.
          If it is not,
          then the <c>NumberField()</c> command should complain
          (which it will not).
        </p>

        <p>
          After adjoining two roots,
          create the extension producing a third root, and do the division.
          You should now have a quadratic factor.
          Assuming the quadratic is irreducible
          (it is)
          argue that you have enough evidence to establish the order of the Galois group,
          and hence can determine <em>exactly</em> which group it is.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can try to use this quadratic factor to create one more step in the extensions,
          and you will arrive at the splitting field,
          as can be seen with logic or division.
          However, this could take a long time to complete
          (save your work beforehand!).
          You can try passing the <c>check=False</c> argument to the <c>NumberField()</c> command <mdash/> this will bypass checking irreducibility.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Create the finite field of order <m>3^6</m>,
          letting Sage supply the default polynomial for its construction.
          The polynomial <m>x^6+x^2+2x+1</m> is irreducible over this finite field.
          Check that this polynomial splits in the finite field,
          and then use the <c>.roots()</c> method to collect the roots of the polynomial.
          Get the group of automorphisms of the field with the <c>End()</c> command.
        </p>

        <p>
          You now have all of the pieces to associate each field automorphism with a permutation of the roots.
          From this, identify the Galois group and all of its subgroups.
          For each subgroup, determine the fixed field.
          You might find the roots easier to work with if you use the <c>.log()</c> method to identify them as powers of the field's multiplicative generator.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your Galois group in this example will be abelian.
          So every subgroup is normal, and hence any extension is also normal.
          Can you extend this example by choosing a nontrivial intermediate field with a nontrivial irreducible polynomial that has all of its roots in the intermediate field and a nontrivial irreducible polynomial with none of its roots in the intermediate field?

        <p>
          Your results here are <q>typical</q>
          in the sense that the particular field or irreducible polynomial makes little difference in the qualitative nature of the results.

    <exercise number="6" xml:id="galois-sage-exercise-degree-168">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The splitting field for the irreducible polynomial <m>p(x)=x^7-7x+3</m> has degree 168
          (hence this is the order of the Galois group).
          This polynomial is derived from an
          <q>Elkies trinomial curve,</q>
          a hyperelliptic curve (below) that produces polynomials with interesting Galois groups:
          <me>
            y^2 = x(81x^5 + 396x^4 + 738x^3 + 660x^2 + 269x + 48)
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          For <m>p(x)</m> the resulting Galois group is <m>PSL(2,7)</m>,
          a simple group.
          If <m>SL(2,7)</m> is all <m>2\times 2</m> matrices over
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_7</m> with determinant 1, then
          <m>PSL(2,7)</m> is the quotient by the subgroup <m>\{I_2,-I_2\}</m>.
          It is the second-smallest non-abelian simple group
          (after <m>A_5</m>).
        </p>

        <p>
          See how far you can get in using Sage to build this splitting field.
          A degree <m>7</m> extension will yield one linear factor,
          and a subsequent degree <m>6</m> extension will yield two linear factors,
          leaving a quartic factor.
          Here is where the computations begin to slow down.
          If we believe that the splitting field has degree <m>168</m>,
          then we know that adding a root from this degree 4 factor will get us to the splitting field.
          Creating this extension may be possible computationally,
          but verifying that the quartic splits into linear factors here seems to be infeasible.

          Return to <xref ref="galois-example-x4-2"/>,
          and the complete list of subfields obtainable from the <c>.subfields()</c> method applied to the flattened tower.
          As mentioned, these are technically not subfields,
          but do have embeddings into the tower.
          Given two subfields,
          their respective primitive elements are embedded into the tower,
          with an image that is a linear combination of powers of the primitive element for the tower.
        </p>

        <p>
          If one subfield is contained in the other,
          then the image of the primitive element for the smaller field should be a linear combination of the (appropriate) powers of the image of the primitive element for the larger field.
          This is a linear algebra computation that should be possible in the tower,
          relative to the power basis for the whole tower.
        </p>

        <p>
          Write a procedure to determine if two subfields are related by one being a subset of the other.
          Then use this procedure to create the lattice of subfields.
          The eventual goal would be a graphical display of the lattice,
          using the existing plotting facilities available for lattices,
          similar to the top half of <xref ref="galois-figure-3"/>.
          This is a <q>challenging</q> exercise,
