  <title>Galois Theory</title>
  <introduction permid="zyO">
    <p permid="gbJ">
      A classic problem of algebra is to find the solutions of a polynomial equation.
      The solution to the quadratic equation was known in antiquity.
      Italian mathematicians found general solutions to the general cubic and quartic equations in the sixteenth century;
      however, attempts to solve the general fifth-degree, or quintic,
      polynomial were repulsed for the next three hundred years.
      Certainly, equations such as
      <m>x^5 - 1 = 0</m> or <m>x^6 - x^3 - 6 = 0</m> could be solved,
      but no solution like the quadratic formula was found for the general quintic,
      <me permid="jUE">
        a x^5 + b x^4 +c x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f = 0
      </me>.
      Finally, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Ruffini and Abel both found quintics that could not be solved with any formula.
      It was Galois, however,
      who provided the full explanation by showing which polynomials could and could not be solved by formulas.
      He discovered the connection between groups and field extensions.
      Galois theory demonstrates the strong interdependence of group and field theory,
      and has had far-reaching implications beyond its original purpose.
    </p>

    <p permid="MiS">
      In this chapter we will prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.
      This result will be used to establish the insolvability of the quintic and to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

        Our first task is to establish a link between group theory and field theory by examining automorphisms of fields.

            The set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is a group under composition of functions.

            If <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are automorphisms of <m>F</m>,
            then so are <m>\sigma \tau</m> and <m>\sigma^{-1}</m>.
            The identity is certainly an automorphism;
            hence, the set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is indeed a group.

            We need only show that the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise is a subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of <m>E</m>.

            Since the identity fixes every element of <m>E</m>,
            the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that leave elements of <m>F</m> fixed is a subgroup of the entire group of automorphisms of <m>E</m>.

            Suppose that <m>E</m> is a finite extension of an infinite field.
            We will prove the result for <m>F(\alpha, \beta)</m>.
            The general case easily follows when we use mathematical induction.
            Let <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> be  the minimal polynomials of <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>,
            respectively.

            All of these zeros have multiplicity <m>1</m>,
            since <m>E</m> is separable over <m>F</m>.

            since <m>\beta</m> is the only zero common to both <m>g(x)</m> and <m>h(x)</m>.
            So <m>\beta \in F( \gamma )</m> and

            The problem is that some of the <m>a_i</m>'s may be in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>.

            Suppose that at least one of the <m>a_i</m>'s is in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>.
            By rearranging the <m>\alpha_i</m>'s we may assume that <m>a_1</m> is nonzero.
            Since any nonzero multiple of a solution is also a solution,
            we can also assume that <m>a_1 = 1</m>.
            Of all possible solutions fitting this description,
            we choose the one with the smallest number of nonzero terms.
            Again, by rearranging <m>\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{n + 1}</m> if necessary,
            we can assume that <m>a_2</m> is in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>.
            Since <m>F</m> is the subfield of <m>E</m> that is fixed elementwise by <m>G</m>,
            there exists a <m>\sigma_i</m> in <m>G</m> such that <m>\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2</m>.
            Applying <m>\sigma_i</m> to each equation in the system,
            we end up with the same homogeneous system,
            since <m>G</m> is a group.
            Therefore, <m>x_1 = \sigma_i(a_1) = 1</m>,
            <m>x_2 = \sigma_i(a_2)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
            <m>x_{n + 1} = \sigma_i(a_{n+1} )</m> is also a solution of the original system.
            We know that a linear combination of two solutions of a homogeneous system is also a solution;
            consequently,
            <md permid="siX">
              <mrow>x_1 &amp; = 1 -1 = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>x_2 &amp; = a_2 - \sigma_i(a_2)</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; \vdots &amp;</mrow>
              <mrow>x_{n + 1} &amp; = a_{n + 1} - \sigma_i(a_{n + 1})</mrow>
            </md>
            must be another solution of the system.
            This is a nontrivial solution because <m>\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2</m>,
            and has fewer nonzero entries than our original solution.
            This is a contradiction,
            since the number of nonzero solutions to our original solution was assumed to be minimal.
            We can therefore conclude that <m>a_1, \ldots, a_{n + 1} \in F</m>.

          In this example we will illustrate the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory by determining the lattice of subgroups of the Galois group of <m>f(x) = x^4 - 2</m>.
          We will compare this lattice to the lattice of field extensions of

          it must be the case that <m>[ {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt[4]{2}, i ): {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}\, )] = 2</m>.

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p permid="rUC">
        Solutions for the cubic and quartic equations were discovered in the 1500s.
        Attempts to find solutions for the quintic equations puzzled some of history's best mathematicians.
        In 1798, P. Ruffini
            <idx><h>Ruffini, P.</h></idx>
        submitted a paper that claimed no such solution could be found;
        however, the paper was not well received.
        In 1826, Niels Henrik Abel
            <idx><h>Abel, Niels Henrik</h></idx>
        (1802<ndash/>1829) finally offered the first correct proof that quintics are not always solvable by radicals.
      </p>

      <p permid="YbL">
        Abel inspired the work of Évariste Galois.
            <idx><h>Galois, Évariste</h></idx>
        Born in 1811, Galois began to display extraordinary mathematical talent at the age of 14.
        He applied for entrance to the École Polytechnique several times;
        however, he had great difficulty meeting the formal entrance requirements,
        and the examiners failed to recognize his mathematical genius.
        He was finally accepted at the École Normale in 1829.
      </p>

      <p permid="EiU">
        Galois worked to develop a theory of solvability for polynomials.
        In 1829, at the age of 17, Galois presented two papers on the solution of algebraic equations to the Académie des Sciences de Paris.
        These papers were sent to Cauchy,
        who subsequently lost them.
        A third paper was submitted to Fourier,
        who died before he could read the paper.
        Another paper was presented, but was not published until 1846.
      </p>

      <p permid="kqd">
        Galois' democratic sympathies led him into the Revolution of 1830.
        He was expelled from school and sent to prison for his part in the turmoil.
        After his release in 1832,
        he was drawn into a duel possibly over a love affair.
        Certain that he would be killed,
        he spent the evening before his death outlining his work and his basic ideas for research in a long letter to his friend Chevalier.
        He was indeed dead the next day, at the age of 20.

        Throughout this section we shall assume that all fields have characteristic zero to ensure that irreducible polynomials do not have multiple roots.
        The immediate goal of this section is to determine when the roots of a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> can be computed with a finite number of operations on the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m>.
        The allowable operations are addition, subtraction,
        multiplication, division, and the extraction of <m>n</m>th roots.
        Certainly the solution to the quadratic equation,
        <m>a x^2 + b x +c = 0</m>, illustrates this process:
        <me permid="hJS">
          x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
        </me>.
        The only one of these operations that might demand a larger field is the taking of <m>n</m>th roots.
        We are led to the following definition.

          We will show that <m>f(x) = x^5 - 6 x^3 - 27 x - 3 \in {\mathbb Q}[x]</m> is not solvable.
          We claim that the Galois group of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is <m>S_5</m>.
          By Eisenstein's Criterion,
          <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible and,
          therefore, must be separable.
          The derivative of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>f'(x) = 5 x^4 - 18 x^2 - 27</m>;
          hence, setting <m>f'(x) = 0</m> and solving,

          between <m>-2</m> and <m>0</m>,
          and once again between <m>0</m> and <m>4</m> (<xref ref="figure-galois-4"/>).
          Therefore, <m>f(x)</m> has exactly three distinct real roots.
          The remaining two roots of <m>f(x)</m> must be complex conjugates.

          we know that <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q})</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_5</m>.

          The automorphism of <m>{\mathbb C}</m> that takes

          it must be the case the <m>[K : \mathbb Q]</m> is divisible by 5.

        It seems fitting that the last theorem that we will state and prove is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
        This theorem was first proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis.
        Prior to Gauss's proof,
        mathematicians suspected that there might exist polynomials over the real and complex numbers having no solutions.
        The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into distinct linear factors.

            Suppose that <m>E</m> is a proper finite field extension of the complex numbers.
            Since any finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a simple extension,
            there exists an <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that
            <m>E = {\mathbb C}( \alpha )</m> with <m>\alpha</m> the root of an irreducible polynomial <m>f(x)</m> in <m>{\mathbb C}[x]</m>.
            The splitting field <m>L</m> of <m>f(x)</m> is a finite normal separable extension of
            <m>{\mathbb C}</m> that contains <m>E</m>.
            We must show that it is impossible for <m>L</m> to be a proper extension of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.

          <p permid="LyY">
            Suppose that <m>L</m> is a proper extension of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
            Since <m>L</m> is the splitting field of

            <m>L</m> is a finite normal separable extension of <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
            Let <m>K</m> be the fixed field of a Sylow 2-subgroup <m>G</m> of <m>G(L/{\mathbb R})</m>.
            Then <m>L \supset K \supset {\mathbb R}</m> and <m>|G( L / K )| =[L:K]</m>.
            Since <m>[L : {\mathbb R}] = [L:K][K:{\mathbb R}]</m>,
            we know that <m>[K:{\mathbb R}]</m> must be odd.
            Consequently,
            <m>K = {\mathbb R}(\beta)</m> with <m>\beta</m> having a minimal polynomial <m>f(x)</m> of odd degree.
            Therefore, <m>K = {\mathbb R}</m>.

          <p permid="rGh">
            We now know that <m>G(L/{\mathbb R})</m> must be a 2-group.
            It follows that <m>G(L / {\mathbb C})</m> is a <m>2</m>-group.
            We have assumed that <m>L \neq {\mathbb C}</m>;
            therefore, <m>|G(L / {\mathbb C})| \geq 2</m>.
            By the first Sylow Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory,
            there exists a subgroup <m>G</m> of
            <m>G(L/{\mathbb C})</m> of index 2 and a field <m>E</m> fixed elementwise by <m>G</m>.

            This polynomial has roots <m>( - b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}\, ) / 2</m> that are in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>,
            since <m>b^2 - 4 c</m> is in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.

      <p permid="tJP">
        Although our proof was strictly algebraic,
        we were forced to rely on results from calculus.
        It is necessary to assume the completeness axiom from analysis to show that every polynomial of odd degree has a real root and that every positive real number has a square root.
        It seems that there is no possible way to avoid this difficulty and formulate a purely algebraic argument.
        It is somewhat amazing that there are several elegant proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that use complex analysis.
        It is also interesting to note that we can obtain a proof of such an important theorem from two very different fields of mathematics.

        So we can compute the value of a field automorphism at any linear combination of powers of the primitive element as a linear combination of the values of the field automorphism at just the powers of the primitive element.
        This is known as the <q>power basis</q>,
        which we can obtain simply with the <c>.power_basis()</c>method.
        We will begin with an example of how we can use this basis.
        We will illustrate with the fourth automorphism of the Galois group.
        Notice that the <c>.vector()</c>method is a convenience that strips a linear combination of the powers of <c>c</c>into a vector of just the coefficients.  (Notice too that <m>\tau</m> is totally defined by the value of <m>\tau(c)</m>,
        since as a field automorphism <m>\tau(c^k)=(\tau(c))^k</m>.
        However, we still need to work with the entire power basis to exploit the vector space structure.)

        to yield slightly simpler minimal polynomials,

          act as if your quotient by the linear factor is irreducible.
          If it is not,
          then the <c>NumberField()</c>command should complain
          (which it will not).

          After adjoining two roots,
          create the extension producing a third root, and do the division.
          You should now have a quadratic factor.
          Assuming the quadratic is irreducible
          (it is)
          argue that you have enough evidence to establish the order of the Galois group,
          and hence can determine <em>exactly</em> which group it is.
        </p>

        <p permid="qfp">
          You can try to use this quadratic factor to create one more step in the extensions,
          and you will arrive at the splitting field,
          as can be seen with logic or division.
          However, this could take a long time to complete
          (save your work beforehand!).
          You can try passing the <c>check=False</c>argument to the <c>NumberField()</c>command <mdash/> this will bypass checking irreducibility.

          Your Galois group in this example will be abelian.

          The splitting field for the irreducible polynomial <m>p(x)=x^7-7x+3</m> has degree 168

          This polynomial is derived from an

          See how far you can get in using Sage to build this splitting field.
          A degree <m>7</m> extension will yield one linear factor,
          and a subsequent degree <m>6</m> extension will yield two linear factors,
          leaving a quartic factor.
          Here is where the computations begin to slow down.
          If we believe that the splitting field has degree <m>168</m>,
          then we know that adding a root from this degree 4 factor will get us to the splitting field.
          Creating this extension may be possible computationally,
          but verifying that the quartic splits into linear factors here seems to be infeasible.

          As mentioned, these are technically not subfields,
          but do have embeddings into the tower.
          Given two subfields,
          their respective primitive elements are embedded into the tower,
          with an image that is a linear combination of powers of the primitive element for the tower.

        <p permid="TrS">
          If one subfield is contained in the other,
          then the image of the primitive element for the smaller field should be a linear combination of the (appropriate) powers of the image of the primitive element for the larger field.
          This is a linear algebra computation that should be possible in the tower,
          relative to the power basis for the whole tower.

          Write a procedure to determine if two subfields are related by one being a subset of the other.
