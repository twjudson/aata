  <title>Cyclic Groups</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The groups <m>\mathbb Z</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>,
      which are among the most familiar and easily understood groups,
      are both examples of what are called cyclic groups.
      In this chapter we will study the properties of cyclic groups and cyclic subgroups,
      which play a fundamental part in the classification of all abelian groups.

    <title>Cyclic Subgroups</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Often a subgroup will depend entirely on a single element of the group;
        that is, knowing that particular element will allow us to compute any other element in the subgroup.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="example-cyclic-z3">
        <p>
          Suppose that we consider <m>3 \in {\mathbb Z}</m> and look at all multiples
          (both positive and negative)
          of <m>3</m>.
          As a set, this is
          <me>
            3 {\mathbb Z} = \{ \ldots, -3, 0, 3, 6, \ldots \}
          </me>.
          It is easy to see that <m>3 {\mathbb Z}</m> is a subgroup of the integers.
          This subgroup is completely determined by the element <m>3</m> since we can obtain all of the other elements of the group by taking multiples of <m>3</m>.
          Every element in the subgroup is
          <q>generated</q> by <m>3</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-cyclic-2n">
        <p>
          If <m>H = \{ 2^n : n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m>,
          then <m>H</m> is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of nonzero rational numbers,
          <m>{\mathbb Q}^*</m>.
          If <m>a = 2^m</m> and <m>b = 2^n</m> are in <m>H</m>,
          then <m>ab^{-1} = 2^m 2^{-n} = 2^{m-n}</m> is also in <m>H</m>.
          By Proposition<nbsp/><xref ref="proposition-subgroup"/>,
          <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Q}^*</m> determined by the element <m>2</m>.

      <theorem xml:id="theorem-cyclic-subgroup">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>a</m> be any element in <m>G</m>.
            Then the set

            <notation>
              <usage>\langle a \rangle</usage>
              <description>cyclic group generated by <m>a</m></description>

            <me>
              \langle a \rangle  = \{ a^k : k \in {\mathbb Z} \}
            </me>
            is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
            Furthermore,
            <m>\langle a \rangle</m> is the smallest subgroup of <m>G</m> that contains <m>a</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            The identity is in <m>\langle a \rangle </m> since <m>a^0 = e</m>.
            If <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are any two elements in <m>\langle a \rangle </m>,
            then by the definition of <m>\langle a \rangle</m> we can write <m>g = a^m</m> and <m>h = a^n</m> for some integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.
            So <m>gh = a^m a^n = a^{m+n}</m> is again in <m>\langle a \rangle </m>.
            Finally, if <m>g = a^n</m> in <m>\langle a \rangle </m>,
            then the inverse <m>g^{-1} = a^{-n}</m> is also in <m>\langle a \rangle </m>.
            Clearly, any subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> containing <m>a</m> must contain all the powers of <m>a</m> by closure;
            hence, <m>H</m> contains <m>\langle a \rangle </m>.
            Therefore, <m>\langle a \rangle </m> is the smallest subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>a</m>.

      <remark>

          If we are using the <q>+</q> notation,

        of <m>a</m> to be the smallest positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>a^n= e</m>,

      <example xml:id="example-cyclic-z6">
        <p>
          Notice that a cyclic group can have more than a single generator.
          Both <m>1</m> and <m>5</m> generate <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m>;
          hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> is a cyclic group.
          Not every element in a cyclic group is necessarily a generator of the group.
          The order of <m>2 \in {\mathbb Z}_6</m> is <m>3</m>.
          The cyclic subgroup generated by <m>2</m> is <m>\langle 2 \rangle = \{ 0, 2, 4 \}</m>.

        The elements <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m> are generators for <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
        We can certainly generate <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> with 1 although there may be other generators of <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>,

      <title>Subgroups of Cyclic Groups</title>
      <p>
        We can ask some interesting questions about cyclic subgroups of a group and subgroups of a cyclic group.
        If <m>G</m> is a group, which subgroups of <m>G</m> are cyclic?
        If <m>G</m> is a cyclic group,
        what type of subgroups does <m>G</m> possess?
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="theorem-cyclic-subgroups">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of Well-Ordering.
            Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group generated by <m>a</m> and suppose that <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
            If <m>H = \{ e \}</m>, then trivially <m>H</m> is cyclic.
            Suppose that <m>H</m> contains some other element <m>g</m> distinct from the identity.
            Then <m>g</m> can be written as <m>a^n</m> for some integer <m>n</m>.
            Since <m>H</m> is a subgroup,
            <m>g^{-1} = a^{-n}</m> must also be in <m>H</m>.
            Since either <m>n</m> or <m>-n</m> is positive,
            we can assume that <m>H</m> contains positive powers of <m>a</m> and <m>n \gt 0</m>.
            Let <m>m</m> be the smallest natural number such that <m>a^m \in H</m>.
            Such an <m>m</m> exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering.
          </p>

          <p>
            We claim that <m>h = a^m</m> is a generator for <m>H</m>.
            We must show that every <m>h' \in H</m> can be written as a power of <m>h</m>.
            Since <m>h' \in H</m> and <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
            <m>h' = a^k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
            Using the division algorithm,
            we can find numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
            <m>k = mq +r</m> where <m>0 \leq r \lt m</m>; hence,
            <me>
              a^k = a^{mq +r} = (a^m)^q a^r = h^q a^r
            </me>.
            So <m>a^r = a^k h^{-q}</m>.
            Since <m>a^k</m> and <m>h^{-q}</m> are in <m>H</m>,
            <m>a^r</m> must also be in <m>H</m>.
            However, <m>m</m> was the smallest positive number such that <m>a^m</m> was in <m>H</m>;
            consequently, <m>r=0</m> and so <m>k=mq</m>.
            Therefore,
            <me>
              h' = a^k = a^{mq} =  h^q
            </me>
            and <m>H</m> is generated by <m>h</m>.

        </proof>

      <corollary>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The subgroups of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> are exactly
            <m>n{\mathbb Z}</m> for <m>n = 0, 1, 2,\ldots</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            First suppose that <m>a^k=e</m>.
            By the division algorithm,

              e = a^k = a^{nq + r} = a^{nq} a^r = e a^r = a^r
            </me>.
            Since the smallest positive integer <m>m</m> such that <m>a^m = e</m> is <m>n</m>,
            <m>r= 0</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conversely, if <m>n</m> divides <m>k</m>,
            then <m>k=ns</m> for some integer <m>s</m>.
            Consequently,

      <p>
        There are several ways of graphically representing complex numbers.
        We can represent a complex number
        <m>z = a +bi</m> as an ordered pair on the <m>xy</m> plane where <m>a</m> is the <m>x</m>
        (or real)
        coordinate and <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>
        (or imaginary)
        coordinate.
        This is called the <term>rectangular</term>
        or <term>Cartesian</term> representation.
        The rectangular representations of
        <m>z_1 = 2 + 3i</m>, <m>z_2 = 1 - 2i</m>,
        and <m>z_3 = - 3 + 2i</m> are depicted in Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="figure-rectcoord"/>.

      <p>
        Nonzero complex numbers can also be represented using
        <term>polar coordinates</term>.
        To specify any nonzero point on the plane,
        it suffices to give an angle <m>\theta</m> from the positive <m>x</m> axis in the counterclockwise direction and a distance <m>r</m> from the origin,
        as in  Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="figure-polarcoord"/>.
        We can see that
        <me>
          z = a + bi = r( \cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
        </me>.
        Hence,
        <me>
          r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
        </me>
        and
        <md>
          <mrow>a &amp; = r \cos \theta</mrow>
          <mrow>b &amp; = r \sin \theta</mrow>
        </md>.
        We sometimes abbreviate <m>r( \cos \theta + i \sin \theta)</m> as <m>r \cis \theta</m>.

        <notation>
          <usage>\cis \theta</usage>
          <description><m>\cos \theta + i \sin \theta</m></description>
        </notation>

        To assure that the representation of <m>z</m> is  well-defined,
        we also require that <m>0^{\circ} \leq \theta \lt 360^{\circ}</m>.
        If the measurement is in radians,
        then <m>0 \leq \theta \lt2 \pi</m>.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="example-cyclic-polar">
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>z = 2 \cis  60^{\circ}</m>.
          Then
          <me>
            a  =  2 \cos 60^{\circ} = 1
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            b = 2 \sin 60^{\circ} = \sqrt{3}
          </me>.
          Hence, the rectangular representation is <m>z = 1+\sqrt{3}\, i</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conversely, if we are given a rectangular representation of a complex number,
          it is often useful to know the number's polar representation.
          If <m>z = 3 \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}\, i</m>, then
          <me>
            r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{36 } = 6
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \theta = \arctan \left( \frac{b}{a} \right) = \arctan( - 1) = 315^{\circ}
          </me>,
          so <m>3 \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}\, i=6 \cis  315^{\circ}</m>.

    <title>The Method of Repeated Squares</title>
    <p>
      Computing large powers can be very time-consuming.
      Just as anyone can compute <m>2^2</m> or <m>2^8</m>,
      everyone knows how to compute
      <me>
        2^{2^{1{,}000{,}000} }
      </me>.
      However, such numbers are so large that we do not want to attempt the calculations;
      moreover, past a certain point the computations would not be feasible even if we had every computer in the world at our disposal.
      Even writing down the decimal representation of a very large number may not be reasonable.
      It could be thousands or even millions of digits long.
      However, if we could compute something like
      <me>
        2^{37{,}398{,}332 } \pmod{ 46{,}389}
      </me>,
      we could very easily write the result down since it would be a number between <m>0</m> and <m>46{,}388</m>.
      If we want to compute powers modulo <m>n</m> quickly and efficiently,
      we will have to be clever.<fn>
      The results in this section are needed only in Chapter<nbsp/><xref ref="crypt"/>
      </fn></p>

    <p>
      The first thing to notice is that any number <m>a</m> can be written as the sum of distinct powers of <m>2</m>;
      that is, we can write
      <me>
        a = 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_2} + \cdots + 2^{k_n}
      </me>,
      where <m>k_1 \lt k_2 \lt \cdots \lt k_n</m>.
      This is just the binary representation of <m>a</m>.
      For example, the binary representation of 57 is 111001,
      since we can write <m>57 = 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The laws of exponents still work in <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>;
      that is, if <m>b \equiv a^x \pmod{ n}</m> and <m>c \equiv a^y \pmod{ n}</m>,
      then <m>bc \equiv a^{x+y} \pmod{ n}</m>.
      We can compute <m>a^{2^k} \pmod{ n}</m> in <m>k</m> multiplications by computing
      <md>
        <mrow>a^{2^0} \pmod{ n}</mrow>
        <mrow>a^{2^1} \pmod{ n }</mrow>
        <mrow>\vdots</mrow>
        <mrow>a^{2^k} \pmod{ n}</mrow>
      </md>.
      Each step involves squaring the answer obtained in the previous step,
      dividing by <m>n</m>, and taking the remainder.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-cyclic-repeated-squares">
      <p>
        We will compute <m>271^{321} \pmod{ 481}</m>.
        Notice that
        <me>
          321 = 2^0 +2^6 + 2^8;
        </me>
        hence, computing <m>271^{ 321} \pmod{ 481}</m> is the same as computing
        <me>
          271^{ 2^0 +2^6 + 2^8 } \equiv 271^{ 2^0 } \cdot 271^{2^6 } \cdot 271^{ 2^8 } \pmod{ 481}
        </me>.
        So it will suffice to compute
        <m>271^{ 2^i } \pmod{ 481}</m> where <m>i = 0, 6, 8</m>.
        It is very easy to see that
        <me>
          271^{ 2^1}  = 73{,}441 \equiv 329 \pmod{ 481}
        </me>.
        We can square this result to obtain a value for <m>271^{ 2^2} \pmod{481}</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>271^{ 2^2}  &amp; \equiv (271^{ 2^1})^2 \pmod{ 481}</mrow>

        We are using the fact that <m>(a^{2^n})^2  \equiv a^{2 \cdot 2^n} \equiv a^{ 2^{n+1} } \pmod{ n}</m>.
        Continuing, we can calculate

          271^{ 2^6 } \equiv 419 \pmod{481}

        and
        <me>
          271^{ 2^8 }  \equiv 16 \pmod{481}
        </me>.
        Therefore,
        <md>
          <mrow>271^{ 321} &amp; \equiv 271^{ 2^0 +2^6 + 2^8 } \pmod{481}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; \equiv 271^{ 2^0 } \cdot 271^{ 2^6 } \cdot 271^{ 2^8 } \pmod{481}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; \equiv 271 \cdot 419 \cdot 16 \pmod{ 481}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; \equiv 1{,}816{,}784 \pmod{ 481}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; \equiv 47 \pmod{ 481}</mrow>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Cyclic groups are very important,
        so it is no surprise that they appear in many different forms in Sage.
        Each is slightly different,
        and no one implementation is ideal for an introduction,
        but together they can illustrate most of the important ideas.
        Here is a guide to the various ways to construct,
        and study, a cyclic group in Sage.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection>
      <title>Infinite Cyclic Groups</title>
      <p>
        In Sage, the integers <m>\mathbb Z</m> are constructed with <c>ZZ</c>.
        To build the infinite cyclic group such as
        <m>3\mathbb Z</m> from Example<nbsp/><xref ref="example-cyclic-z3"/>, simply use <c>3*ZZ</c>.
        As an infinite set, there is not a whole lot you can do with this.
        You can test if integers are in this set, or not.
        You can also recall the generator with the <c>.gen()</c> command.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
            G = 3*ZZ
            -12 in G
            </input>
                <output>True</output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
            37 in G
            </input>
                <output>False</output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
            G.gen()
            </input>
                <output>3</output>
            </sage>
    </subsection>

    <subsection>
      <title>Additive Cyclic Groups</title>
      <p>
        The additive cyclic group <m>\mathbb Z_n</m> can be built as a special case of a more general Sage construction.
        First we build <m>\mathbb Z_{14}</m> and capture its generator.
        Throughout, pay close attention to the use of parentheses and square brackets for when you experiment on your own.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
            G = AdditiveAbelianGroup([14])
            G.order()
            </input>
                <output>14</output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>G.list()</input>
                <output>
            [(0), (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7),
             (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13)]
            </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
            a = G.gen(0)
            a
            </input>
                <output>(1)</output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        You can compute in this group, by using the generator,
        or by using new elements formed by coercing integers into the group,
        or by taking the result of operations on other elements.
        And we can compute the order of elements in this group.
        Notice that we can perform repeated additions with the shortcut of taking integer multiples of an element.
      </p>

                <input>
            a + a

            </sage>
            <sage>

            </input>
                <output>(4)</output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>

            </input>
                <output>(9)</output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        We can create, and then compute with,
        new elements of the group by coercing an integer
        (in a list of length <m>1</m>)
        into the group.
        You may get a <c>DeprecationWarning</c> the first time you use this syntax to create a new element.
        The mysterious warning can be safely ignored.

      <p>
        It is possible to create cyclic subgroups,
        from an element designated to be the new generator.
        Unfortunately, to do this requires the <c>.submodule()</c> method
        (which should be renamed in Sage).

            </sage>

      <p>
        The cyclic subgroup <c>H</c> just created has more than one generator.
        We can test this by building a new subgroup and comparing the two subgroups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certainly the list of elements,
        and the common generator of <c>(2)</c> lead us to belive that <c>H</c> and <c>K</c> are the same,

        Results in this section,
        especially Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="theorem-cyclic-orders"/> and Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="corollary-cyclic-modngenerators"/>,
        can be investigated by creating generators of subgroups from a generator of one additive cyclic group,
        creating the subgroups,
        and computing the orders of both elements and orders of groups.

      <title>Abstract Multiplicative Cyclic Groups</title>
      <p>
        We can create an abstract cyclic group in the style of Theorems<nbsp/><xref ref="theorem-cyclic-subgroup"/>,
        <xref ref="theorem-cyclic-abelian"/>, <xref ref="theorem-cyclic-subgroups"/>.
        In the syntax below <c>a</c> is a name for the generator,
        and <c>14</c> is the order of the element.
        Notice that the notation is now multiplicative,
        so we multiply elements, and repeated products can be written as powers.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
            G.&lt;a&gt; = AbelianGroup([14])
            G.order()

      <p>
        Computations in the group are similar to before,
        only with different notation.
        Now products, with repeated products written as exponentiation.

      <p>
        Subgroups can be formed with a <c>.subgroup()</c> command.
        But do not try to list the contents of a subgroup,
        it'll look strangely unfamiliar.
        Also, comparison of subgroups is not implemented.
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
            H = G.subgroup([a^2])
            H.order()

                <output>7</output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
            K = G.subgroup([a^12])
            K.order()
            </input>
                <output>7</output>
            </sage>
            <!-- Subgroup equality is buggy, L and H are the subgroup of order 7 -->
            <sage type="hidden">

                L = G.subgroup([a^4])

            </input>
                <output>False</output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        One advantage of this implementation is the possibility to create all possible subgroups.
        Here we create the list of subgroups, extract one in particular
        (the third),
        and check its order.

      <title>Cyclic Permutation Groups</title>
      <p>
        We will learn more about permutation groups in the next chapter.
        But we will mention here that it is easy to create cyclic groups as permutation groups,
        and a variety of methods are available for working with them,
        even if the actual elements get a bit cumbersome to work with.
        As before, notice that the notation and syntax is multiplicative.

        It could help to visualize this group, and the subgroup,
        as rotations of a regular <m>12</m>-gon with the vertices labeled with the integers <m>1</m> through <m>12</m>.
        This is not the full group of symmetries,
        since it does not include reflections,
        just the <m>12</m> rotations.

      <p>
        As groups, each of the examples above
        (groups and subgroups)
        have Cayley tables implemented.
        Since the groups are cyclic, and their subgroups are therefore cyclic,
        the Cayley tables should have a similar <q>cyclic</q> pattern.
        Note that the letters used in the default table are generic,
        and are not related to the letters used above for specific elements <mdash/> they just match up with the group elements in the order given by <c>.list()</c>.

      <title>Complex Roots of Unity</title>
      <p>
        The finite cyclic subgroups of <m>{\mathbb T}</m>,
        generated by a primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity are implemented as a more general construction in Sage,
        known as a cyclotomic field.
        If you concentrate on just the multiplication of powers of a generator
        (and ignore the infinitely many other elements)
        then this is a finite cyclic group.
        Since this is not implemented directly in Sage as a group,
        <foreign>per se</foreign>,
        it is a bit harder to construct things like subgroups,
        but it is an excellent exercise to try.
        It is a nice example since the complex numbers are a concrete and familiar construction.
        Here are a few sample calculations to provide you with some exploratory tools.
        See the notes following the computations.

            <p>
              <c>zeta14</c> is the name of the generator used for the cyclotomic field,
              it is a primitive root of unity (a <m>14</m>th root of unity in this case).
              We have captured it as <c>w</c>.

          <li>
            <p>
              The syntax <c>CDF(w)</c> will convert the complex number <c>w</c> into the more familiar form with real and imaginary parts.

          <li>
            <p>
              The method <c>.abs()</c> will return the modulus of a complex number,
              <m>r</m> as described in the text.
              For elements of <m>{\mathbb C}^\ast</m> this should always equal <m>1</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              The method <c>.arg()</c> will return the argument of a complex number,
              <m>\theta</m> as described in the text.
              Every element of the cyclic group in this example should have an argument that is an integer multiple of <m>\frac{2\pi}{14}</m>.
              The <c>N()</c> syntax converts the symbolic value of <c>pi</c> to a numerical approximation.

          <li>
            <p>
              <c>sg</c> is a list of elements that form a cyclic subgroup of order 7, composed of the first 7 powers of <c>b = w^2</c>.
              So, for example,
              the last comparison multiplies the fifth power of <c>b</c> with the sixth power of <c>b</c>,
              which would be the eleventh power of <c>b</c>.
              But since <c>b</c> has order 7, this reduces to the fourth power.

            <p>
              If you know a subset of an infinite group forms a subgroup,
              then you can produce its Cayley table by specifying the list of elements you want to use.
              Here we ask for a multiplication table,
              since that is the relevant operation.

    <title>Sage Exercises</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        This group of exercises is about the group of units mod <m>n</m>,
        <m>U(n)</m>, which is sometimes cyclic, sometimes not.
        There are some commands in Sage that will answer some of these questions very quickly,
        but instead of using those now,
        just use the basic techniques described.
        The idea here is to just work with elements,
        and lists of elements, to discern the subgroup structure of these groups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sage worksheets have extensive capabilities for making new cells with carefully formatted text,
        include support for <latex/> syntax to express mathematics.
        So when a question asks for explanation or commentary,
        make a new cell and communicate clearly with your audience.
        Continue this practice in subsequent exercise sets.

        <p>
          Execute the statement <c>R = Integers(40)</c> to create the set <c>[0,1,2,...,39]</c> This is a group under addition mod <m>40</m>,
          which we will ignore.
          Instead we are interested in the subset of elements which have an inverse under
          <em>multiplication</em> mod <m>40</m>.
          Determine how big this subgroup is by executing the command <c>R.unit_group_order()</c>,
          and then obtain a list of these elements with <c>R.list_of_elements_of_multiplicative_group()</c>.

          You can create elements of this group by coercing regular integers into <c>U</c>,
          such as with the statement <c>a = U(7)</c>. (Don't confuse this with our mathematical notation <m>U(40)</m>.) This will tell Sage that you want to view <m>7</m> as an element of <m>U</m>,
          subject to the corresponding operations.
          Determine the elements of the cyclic subgroup of <m>U</m> generated by <m>7</m> with a list comprehension as follows:

        <p>
          The group <m>U(49)</m> is cyclic.
          Using only the Sage commands described previously,
          use Sage to find a generator for this group.
          Now using <em>only</em> theorems about the structure of cyclic groups,
          describe each of the subgroups of <m>U(49)</m> by specifying its order and by giving an explicit generator.
          Do not repeat any of the subgroups <mdash/> in other words,
          present each subgroup <em>exactly</em> once.
          You can use Sage to check your work on the subgroups,
          but your answer about the subgroups should rely only on theorems and be a nicely written paragraph with a table, etc.

      <statement>
        <p>
          The group <m>U(35)</m> is not cyclic.
          Again, using only the Sage commands described previously,
          use computations to provide irrefutable evidence of this.
          How many of the <m>16</m> different subgroups of <m>U(35)</m> can you list?

    <exercise number="5">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Again, using only the Sage commands described previously,
          explore the structure of <m>U(n)</m> for various values of <m>n</m> and see if you can formulate an interesting conjecture about some basic property of this group.
          (Yes, this is a <em>very</em> open-ended question,
          but this is ultimately the real power of exploring mathematics with Sage.)
