<chapter xml:id="vect" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<title>Vector Spaces</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>In a physical system a quantity can often be described with a single number. For example, we need to know only a single number to describe temperature, mass, or volume.  However, for some quantities, such as location, we need several numbers. To give the location of a point in space, we need <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> coordinates. Temperature distribution over a solid object requires four numbers: three to identify each point within the object and a fourth to describe the temperature at that point.  Often <m>n</m>-tuples of numbers, or vectors, also have certain algebraic properties, such as addition or scalar multiplication.</p>

		<p>In this chapter we will examine mathematical structures called vector spaces. As with groups and rings, it is desirable to give a simple list of axioms that must be satisfied to make a set of vectors a structure worth studying.</p>
	</introduction>

		<title>Definitions and Examples</title>
 
		<p>A <term>vector space</term><index><main>Vector space</main><sub>definition of</sub></index> <m>V</m> over a field <m>F</m> is an abelian group with a <term>scalar product</term><index><main>Scalar product</main></index> <m>\alpha \cdot v</m> or <m>\alpha v</m> defined for all <m>\alpha \in F</m> and all <m>v \in V</m> satisfying the following axioms.
			<ul>

				<li><p><m>\alpha(\beta v) =(\alpha \beta)v</m>;</p></li>

				<li><p><m>(\alpha + \beta)v =\alpha v + \beta v</m>;</p></li>

				<li><p><m>\alpha(u + v) = \alpha u + \alpha v</m>;</p></li>

				<li><p><m>1v=v</m>;</p></li>

			</ul>
		where <m>\alpha, \beta \in F</m> and <m>u, v \in V</m>.</p>

		<p>The elements of <m>V</m> are called <term>vectors</term>; the elements of <m>F</m> are called <term>scalars</term>.  It is important to notice that in most cases two vectors cannot be multiplied.  In general, it is only possible to multiply a vector with a scalar. To differentiate between the scalar zero and the vector zero, we will write them as 0 and <m>{\mathbf 0}</m>, respectively.</p>

		<p>Let us examine several examples of vector spaces. Some of them will be quite familiar; others will seem less so.</p>

		<example xml:id="example-vect-space0-rn">
			<p>The <m>n</m>-tuples of real numbers, denoted by <m>{\mathbb R}^n</m>, form a vector space over <m>{\mathbb R}</m>. Given vectors <m>u = (u_1, \ldots, u_n)</m> and <m>v = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)</m> in <m>{\mathbb R}^n</m> and <m>\alpha</m> in <m>{\mathbb R}</m>, we can define vector addition by
				<me>u + v = (u_1, \ldots, u_n) + (v_1, \ldots, v_n) = (u_1 + v_1, \ldots, u_n + v_n)</me>
			and scalar multiplication by 
				<me>\alpha u = \alpha(u_1, \ldots, u_n)= (\alpha u_1, \ldots, \alpha u_n).</me></p>
		</example>
 
		<example xml:id="example-vect-space-fx">
			<p>If <m>F</m> is a field, then <m>F[x]</m> is a vector space over <m>F</m>. The vectors in <m>F[x]</m> are simply polynomials, and vector addition is just polynomial addition. If <m>\alpha \in F</m> and <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>, then scalar multiplication is defined by <m>\alpha p(x)</m>.</p>
		</example>
 
		<example xml:id="example-vect-space-cont-func">
			<p>The set of all continuous real-valued functions on a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> is a vector space over <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.  If <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are continuous on <m>[a, b]</m>, then <m>(f+g)(x)</m> is defined to be <m>f(x) + g(x)</m>.  Scalar multiplication is defined by <m>(\alpha f)(x) = \alpha f(x)</m> for <m>\alpha \in  {\mathbb R}</m>. For example, if <m>f(x) = \sin x</m> and <m>g(x)= x^2</m>, then <m>(2f + 5g)(x) =2 \sin x + 5 x^2</m>.</p>
		</example>
 
		<example xml:id="example-vect-space-sqrt2">
			<p>Let <m>V = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{2}\, ) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in  {\mathbb Q } \}</m>. Then <m>V</m> is a vector space over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>. If <m>u = a + b \sqrt{2}</m> and <m>v = c + d \sqrt{2}</m>, then <m>u + v = (a + c) + (b + d ) \sqrt{2}</m> is again in <m>V</m>. Also, for <m>\alpha \in {\mathbb Q}</m>, <m>\alpha v</m> is in <m>V</m>.  We will leave it as an exercise to verify that all of the vector space axioms hold for <m>V</m>.</p>
		</example>

		<proposition>
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>V</m> be a vector space over <m>F</m>. Then each of the following statements is true.
					<ol>

						<li><p><m>0v ={\mathbf 0}</m> for all <m>v \in V</m>.</p></li>

						<li><p><m>\alpha {\mathbf 0} = {\mathbf 0}</m> for all <m>\alpha \in F</m>.</p></li>

						<li><p>If <m>\alpha v = {\mathbf 0}</m>, then either <m>\alpha = 0</m> or <m>v = {\mathbf 0}</m>.</p></li>

						<li><p><m>(-1) v = -v</m> for all <m>v \in V</m>.</p></li>

						<li><p><m>-(\alpha v) = (-\alpha)v = \alpha(-v)</m> for all <m>\alpha \in F</m> and all <m>v \in V</m>.</p></li>

					</ol></p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>To prove (1), observe that 
					<me>0 v = (0 + 0)v = 0v + 0v;</me>
				consequently, <m>{\mathbf 0} + 0 v = 0v + 0v</m>. Since <m>V</m> is an abelian group, <m>{\mathbf 0} = 0v</m>.</p>

				<p>The proof of (2) is almost identical to the proof of (1). For (3), we are done if <m>\alpha = 0</m>.  Suppose that <m>\alpha \neq 0</m>. Multiplying both sides of <m>\alpha v = {\mathbf 0}</m> by <m>1/ \alpha</m>, we have <m>v = {\mathbf 0}</m>.</p>

				<p>To show (4), observe that
					<me>v + (-1)v = 1v + (-1)v = (1-1)v = 0v = {\mathbf 0},</me>
				and so <m>-v = (-1)v</m>. We will leave the proof of (5) as an exercise.</p>

		<title>Subspaces</title>

		<p>Just as groups have subgroups and rings have subrings, vector spaces also have substructures. Let <m>V</m> be a vector space over a field <m>F</m>, and <m>W</m> a subset of <m>V</m>. Then <m>W</m> is a <term>subspace</term><index><main>Vector space</main><sub>subspace of</sub></index> of <m>V</m> if it is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication; that is, if <m>u, v \in W</m> and <m>\alpha \in F</m>, it will always be the case that <m>u + v</m> and <m>\alpha v</m> are also in <m>W</m>.</p>

			<p>Let <m>W</m> be the subspace of <m>{\mathbb R}^3</m> defined by <m>W = \{ (x_1, 2 x_1 + x_2, x_1 - x_2) : x_1, x_2 \in {\mathbb R} \}</m>. We claim that <m>W</m> is a  subspace of <m>{\mathbb R}^3</m>.  Since

		<p>Let <m>V</m> be any vector space over a field <m>F</m> and suppose that <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n</m> are vectors in <m>V</m> and <m>\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n</m> are scalars in <m>F</m>. Any vector <m>w</m> in <m>V</m> of the form

		<title>Linear Independence</title>

		<p>Let <m>S = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}</m> be a set of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m>. If there exist scalars <m>\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \ldots \alpha_n \in F</m> such that not all of the <m>\alpha_i</m>'s are zero and 
			<me>\alpha_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 v_2 + \cdots + \alpha_n v_n = {\mathbf 0 },</me>
		then <m>S</m> is said to be <term>linearly dependent</term><index><main>Linear dependence</main></index>. If the set <m>S</m> is not linearly dependent, then it is said to be <term>linearly independent</term><index><main>Linear independence</main></index>. More specifically, <m>S</m> is a linearly independent set if

		implies that
			<me>\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \cdots = \alpha_n = 0</me>
		for any set of scalars <m>\{ \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \ldots \alpha_n \}</m>.</p>

		<proposition>
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>\{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \}</m> be a set of linearly independent vectors in a vector space. Suppose that 
					<me>v = \alpha_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 v_2 + \cdots + \alpha_n v_n = \beta_1 v_1 + \beta_2 v_2 + \cdots + \beta_n v_n.</me>

			<proof>
				<p>If

			</proof>
		</proposition>

		<p>The definition of linear dependence makes more sense if we consider the following proposition.</p>

		<proposition>
			<statement>
				<p>A set <m>\{ v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \}</m> of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m> is linearly dependent if and only if one of the <m>v_i</m>'s is a linear combination of the rest. </p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>Suppose that <m>\{ v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \}</m> is a set of linearly dependent vectors.  Then there exist scalars <m>\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n</m> such that
					<me>\alpha_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 v_2 + \cdots + \alpha_n v_n = {\mathbf 0 },</me>
				with at least one of the <m>\alpha_i</m>'s not equal to zero.  Suppose that <m>\alpha_k \neq 0</m>. Then 
					<me>v_k = - \frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_k} v_1 - \cdots - \frac{\alpha_{k - 1}}{\alpha_k}	v_{k-1} - \frac{\alpha_{k + 1}}{\alpha_k}	v_{k + 1} - \cdots  - \frac{\alpha_n}{\alpha_k} v_n.</me></p>

				<p>Conversely, suppose that 
					<me>v_k = \beta_1 v_1 + \cdots + \beta_{k - 1} v_{k - 1} + \beta_{k + 1} v_{k + 1} + \cdots + \beta_n v_n.</me>
				Then
					<me>\beta_1 v_1 + \cdots + \beta_{k - 1} v_{k - 1} - v_k + \beta_{k + 1} v_{k + 1} + \cdots + \beta_n v_n = {\mathbf 0}.</me></p>
			</proof>
		</proposition>

		<p>The following proposition is a consequence of the fact that any system of homogeneous linear equations with more unknowns than equations will have a nontrivial solution.  We leave the details of the proof for the end-of-chapter exercises.</p>
 
		<proposition xml:id="proposition-linearly-independent">
			<statement>
				<p>Suppose that a vector space <m>V</m> is spanned by <m>n</m> vectors. If <m>m \gt n</m>, then any set of <m>m</m> vectors in <m>V</m> must be linearly dependent.</p>
			</statement>
		</proposition>
 
		<p>A set <m>\{ e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \}</m> of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m> is called a <term>basis</term><index><main>Vector space</main><sub>basis of</sub></index> for <m>V</m> if <m>\{ e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \}</m> is a linearly independent set that spans <m>V</m>.</p>
 
		<example xml:id="example-vect-basis-r3">
			<p>The vectors <m>e_1 = (1, 0, 0)</m>, <m>e_2 = (0, 1, 0)</m>, and <m>e_3 =(0, 0, 1)</m> form a basis for <m>{\mathbb R}^3</m>.  The set certainly spans <m>{\mathbb R}^3</m>, since any arbitrary vector <m>(x_1, x_2, x_3)</m> in <m>{\mathbb R}^3</m> can be written as <m>x_1 e_1 + x_2 e_2 + x_3 e_3</m>. Also, none of the vectors <m>e_1, e_2, e_3</m> can be written as a linear combination of the other two; hence, they are linearly independent.  The vectors <m>e_1, e_2, e_3</m> are not the only basis of <m>{\mathbb R}^3</m>:  the set <m>\{ (3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 0), (1, 1, 1) \}</m> is also a basis for <m>{\mathbb R}^3</m>.</p>
		</example>

		<example xml:id="example-vect-basis-sqrt2">
			<p>Let <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{2}\, ) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}</m>. The sets <m>\{1, \sqrt{2}\,  \}</m> and <m>\{1 + \sqrt{2}, 1 - \sqrt{2}\,  \}</m> are both bases of <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{2}\, )</m>.</p>
		</example>

		<p>From the last two examples it should be clear that a given vector space has several bases. In fact, there are an infinite number of bases for both of these examples. \emph{In general, there is no unique basis for a vector space}.  However, every basis of <m>{\mathbb R}^3</m> consists of exactly three vectors, and every  basis of <m>{\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{2}\, )</m> consists of exactly two vectors. This is a consequence of the next proposition.</p>

		<proposition>
			<statement>
				<p>Let <m>\{ e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m \}</m> and <m>\{ f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n \}</m> be two bases for a vector space <m>V</m>. Then <m>m = n</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>Since <m>\{ e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_m \}</m> is a basis, it is a linearly independent set. By Proposition<nbsp /><xref ref="proposition-linearly-independent" />, <m>n \leq m</m>. Similarly, <m>\{ f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n \}</m> is a linearly independent set, and the last proposition implies that <m>m \leq n</m>. Consequently, <m>m = n</m>.</p>
