  <title>Rings</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Up to this point we have studied sets with a single binary operation satisfying certain axioms,
      but we are often more interested in working with sets that have two binary operations.
      For example,
      one of the most natural algebraic structures to study is the integers with the operations of addition and multiplication.
      These operations are related to one another by the distributive property.
      If we consider a set with two such related binary operations satisfying certain axioms,
      we have an algebraic structure called a ring.
      In a ring we add and multiply elements such as real numbers,
      complex numbers, matrices, and functions.

      A nonempty set <m>R</m> is a <term>ring</term><idx><h>Ring</h><h>definition of</h></idx> if it has two closed binary operations,
      addition and multiplication, satisfying the following conditions.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>a + b = b + a</m> for <m>a, b \in R</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>(a + b) + c = a + ( b + c)</m> for <m>a, b, c \in R</m>.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            There is an element <m>0</m> in <m>R</m> such that
            <m>a + 0 = a</m> for all <m>a \in R</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            For every element <m>a \in R</m>,
            there exists an element <m>-a</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>a + (-a) = 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>(ab) c = a ( b c)</m> for <m>a, b, c \in R</m>.

        <li>
          <p>

      </ol>

      This last condition, the distributive axiom,
      relates the binary operations of addition and multiplication.
      Notice that the first four axioms simply require that a ring be an abelian group under addition,
      so we could also have defined a ring to be an abelian group <m>(R, +)</m> together with a second binary operation satisfying the fifth and sixth conditions given above.

    <example xml:id="rings-example-integers">
      <p>
        As we have mentioned previously, the integers form a ring.
        In fact, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is an integral domain.
        Certainly if <m>a b = 0</m> for two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
        either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>.
        However, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is not a field.
        There is no integer that is the multiplicative inverse of <m>2</m>,
        since <m>1/2</m> is not an integer.
        The only integers with multiplicative inverses are <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="rings-example-field">
      <p>
        Under the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication,
        all of the familiar number systems are rings:
        the rationals, <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>;
        the real numbers, <m>{\mathbb R}</m>;
        and the complex numbers, <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
        Each of these rings is a field.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="rings-example-zn">
      <p>
        We can define the product of two elements <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> by <m>ab \pmod{n}</m>.
        For instance, in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>,
        <m>5 \cdot 7 \equiv 11 \pmod{12}</m>.
        This product makes the abelian group <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> into a ring.
        Certainly <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is a commutative ring;
        however, it may fail to be an integral domain.
        If we consider <m>3 \cdot 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{12}</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>,
        it is easy to see that a product of two nonzero elements in the ring can be equal to zero.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      A nonzero element <m>a</m> in a commutative ring <m>R</m> is called a <term>zero divisor</term><idx><h>Zero divisor</h></idx>
      if there is a nonzero element <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>ab = 0</m>.
      In the previous example,
      <m>3</m> and <m>4</m> are zero divisors in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="rings-example-functions">
      <p>
        In calculus the continuous real-valued functions on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> form a commutative ring.
        We add or multiply two functions by adding or multiplying the values of the functions.
        If <m>f(x) = x^2</m> and <m>g(x) = \cos x</m>,
        then <m>(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = x^2 + \cos x</m> and <m>(fg)(x) = f(x) g(x) = x^2 \cos x</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="rings-example-matrix">
      <p>
        The <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices with entries in
        <m>{\mathbb R}</m> form a ring under the usual operations of matrix addition and multiplication.
        This ring is noncommutative,
        since it is usually the case that <m>AB \neq BA</m>.
        Also, notice that we can have <m>AB = 0</m> when neither <m>A</m> nor <m>B</m> is zero.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="rings-example-noncommutative">
      <p>
        For an example of a noncommutative division ring, let
        <me>
          1 = 
          \begin{pmatrix}
          1 &amp; 0 \\

          \end{pmatrix},
          \quad
          {\mathbf j} =
          \begin{pmatrix}
          0 &amp; i \\
          i &amp; 0
          \end{pmatrix},
          \quad
          {\mathbf k} = 
          \begin{pmatrix}

          \end{pmatrix}

        where <m>i^2 = -1</m>.
        These elements satisfy the following relations:

          <mrow>{\mathbf i}  {\mathbf k} &amp; =  - {\mathbf j}</mrow>
        </md>.
        Let <m>{\mathbb H}</m> consist of elements of the form <m>a + b {\mathbf i} + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k}</m>,
        where <m>a, b , c, d</m> are real numbers.
        Equivalently,
        <m>{\mathbb H}</m> can be considered to be the set of all <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices of the form

          \end{pmatrix}
        </me>,
        where <m>\alpha = a + di</m> and <m>\beta = b + ci</m> are complex numbers.
        We can define addition and multiplication on
        <m>{\mathbb H}</m> either by the usual matrix operations or in terms of the generators <m>1</m>,
        <m>{\mathbf i}</m>, <m>{\mathbf j}</m>, and <m>{\mathbf k}</m>:

        Though multiplication looks complicated,
        it is actually a straightforward computation if we remember that we just add and multiply elements in
        <m>{\mathbb H}</m> like polynomials and keep in mind the relationships between the generators <m>{\mathbf i}</m>,
        <m>{\mathbf j}</m>, and <m>{\mathbf k}</m>.
        The ring <m>{\mathbb H}</m> is called the ring of <idx><h>Quaternions</h></idx><term>quaternions</term>.

            <!-- TWJ 2/6/2013  -->
      <p>
        To show that the quaternions are a division ring,
        we must be able to find an inverse for each nonzero element.
        Notice that
        <me>
          ( a + b {\mathbf i} + c {\mathbf j} + d {\mathbf k} )( a - b {\mathbf i} - c {\mathbf j} - d {\mathbf k} ) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2
        </me>.
        This element can be zero only if <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
        <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m> are all zero.
        So if <m>a + b {\mathbf i} + c {\mathbf j} +d {\mathbf k} \neq 0</m>,
        <me>
          (a + b {\mathbf i} + c {\mathbf j} + d {\mathbf k})\left( \frac{a - b {\mathbf i} - c {\mathbf j} - d {\mathbf k} }{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2} \right) = 1
        </me>.

    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a ring with <m>a, b \in R</m>.
          Then

      <proof>
        <p>
          To prove (1), observe that
          <me>
            a0 = a(0+0)= a0+ a0;
          </me>
          hence, <m>a0=0</m>.
          Similarly, <m>0a = 0</m>.
          For (2), we have <m>ab + a(-b) = a(b-b) = a0 = 0</m>;
          consequently, <m>-ab = a(-b)</m>.
          Similarly, <m>-ab = (-a)b</m>.
          Part (3) follows directly from (2) since <m>(-a)(-b) = -(a(- b)) = -(-ab) = ab</m>.

    <p>
      Just as we have subgroups of groups,
      we have an analogous class of substructures for rings.
      A <term>subring</term><idx><h>Subring</h></idx>
      <m>S</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is a subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m> such that <m>S</m> is also a ring under the inherited operations from <m>R</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="rings-example-subring-chain">
      <p>
        The ring <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m> is a subring of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
        Notice that even though the original ring may have an identity,
        we do not require that its subring have an identity.
        We have the following chain of subrings:

          {\mathbb Z} \subset {\mathbb Q} \subset {\mathbb R} \subset {\mathbb C}

      Let us briefly recall some definitions.
      If <m>R</m> is a commutative ring and <m>r</m> is a nonzero element in <m>R</m>,
      then <m>r</m> is said to be a <term>zero divisor</term>
      if there is some nonzero element <m>s \in R</m> such that <m>rs = 0</m>.
      A commutative ring with identity is said to be an
      <term>integral domain</term> if it has no zero divisors.
      If an element <m>a</m> in a ring <m>R</m> with identity has a multiplicative inverse,
      we say that <m>a</m> is a <term>unit</term>.
      If every nonzero element in a ring <m>R</m> is a unit,
      then <m>R</m> is called a <term>division ring</term>.
      A commutative division ring is called a <term>field</term>.

        If <m>i^2 = -1</m>, then the set
        <m>{\mathbb Z}[ i ] = \{ m + ni : m, n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m> forms a ring known as the

          <usage><m>\mathbb Z[i]</m></usage>
          <description>the Gaussian integers</description>
        </notation>
        It is easily seen that the Gaussian integers are a subring of the complex numbers since they are closed under addition and multiplication.
        Let <m>\alpha = a + bi</m> be a unit in <m>{\mathbb Z}[ i ]</m>.
        Then <m>\overline{\alpha} = a - bi</m> is also a unit since if <m>\alpha \beta = 1</m>,
        then <m>\overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = 1</m>.
        If <m>\beta = c + di</m>, then
        <me>
          1 = \alpha \beta \overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = (a^2 + b^2 )(c^2 + d^2)
        </me>.
        Therefore, <m>a^2 + b^2</m> must either be <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m>;
        or, equivalently, <m>a + bi = \pm 1</m> or <m>a + bi = \pm i</m>.
        Therefore, units of this ring are <m>\pm 1</m> and <m>\pm i</m>;
        hence, the Gaussian integers are not a field.
        We will leave it as an exercise to prove that the Gaussian integers are an integral domain.

      The following surprising theorem is due to Wedderburn.
    </p>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Every finite integral domain is a field.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be a finite integral domain and <m>D^\ast</m> be the set of nonzero elements of <m>D</m>.
          We must show that every element in <m>D^*</m> has an inverse.
          For each <m>a \in D^\ast</m> we can define a map
          <m>\lambda_a : D^\ast \rightarrow D^\ast</m> by <m>\lambda_a(d) = ad</m>.
          This map makes sense, because if  <m>a \neq 0</m> and
          <m>d \neq 0</m>, then <m>ad \neq 0</m>.
          The map <m>\lambda_a</m> is one-to-one,
          since for <m>d_1, d_2 \in D^*</m>,
          <me>
            ad_1 = \lambda_a(d_1) = \lambda_a(d_2) = ad_2
          </me>
          implies <m>d_1 = d_2</m> by left cancellation.
          Since <m>D^\ast</m> is a finite set,
          the map <m>\lambda_a</m> must also be onto;
          hence, for some <m>d \in D^\ast</m>,
          <m>\lambda_a(d) = ad = 1</m>.
          Therefore, <m>a</m> has a left inverse.
          Since <m>D</m> is commutative,
          <m>d</m> must also be a right inverse for <m>a</m>.
          Consequently, <m>D</m> is a field.

          <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is a principal ideal.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          The zero ideal <m>\{ 0 \}</m> is a principal ideal since <m>\langle 0 \rangle = \{ 0 \}</m>.
          If  <m>I</m> is any nonzero ideal in <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>,
          then  <m>I</m> must contain some positive integer <m>m</m>.
          There exists a least positive integer <m>n</m> in <m>I</m> by the Principle of Well-Ordering.
          Now let <m>a</m> be any element in <m>I</m>.
          Using the division algorithm,
          we know that there exist integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
          <me>
            a = nq + r
          </me>
          where <m>0 \leq r \lt n</m>.
          This equation tells us that <m>r = a - nq \in I</m>,
          but <m>r</m> must be <m>0</m> since <m>n</m> is the least positive element in <m>I</m>.
          Therefore, <m>a = nq</m> and <m>I = \langle n \rangle</m>.

    <title>Maximal and Prime Ideals</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this particular section we are especially interested in certain ideals of commutative rings.
        These ideals give us special types of factor rings.
        More specifically,
        we would like to characterize those ideals <m>I</m> of a commutative ring <m>R</m> such that <m>R/I</m> is an integral domain or a field.
      </p>

      <p>
        A proper ideal <m>M</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is a
        <term>maximal ideal</term><idx><h>Ideal</h><h>maximal</h></idx><idx><h>Maximal ideal</h></idx>
        of <m>R</m> if the ideal <m>M</m> is not a proper subset of any ideal of <m>R</m> except <m>R</m> itself.
        That is, <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal if for any ideal <m>I</m> properly containing <m>M</m>,
        <m>I = R</m>.
        The following theorem completely characterizes maximal ideals for commutative rings with identity in terms of their corresponding factor rings.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="rings-theorem-maximal-ideal-field">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity and <m>M</m> an ideal in <m>R</m>.
            Then <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal of <m>R</m> if and only if <m>R/M</m> is a field.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>M</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>.
            If <m>R</m> is a commutative ring,
            then <m>R/M</m> must also be a commutative ring.
            Clearly, <m>1 + M</m> acts as an identity for <m>R/M</m>.
            We must also show that every nonzero element in <m>R/M</m> has an inverse.
            If <m>a + M</m> is a nonzero element in <m>R/M</m>, then <m>a \notin M</m>.
            Define <m>I</m> to be the set <m>\{ ra + m : r \in R \text{ and } m \in M \}</m>.
            We will show that <m>I</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m>.
            The set <m>I</m> is nonempty since <m>0a+0=0</m> is in <m>I</m>.
            If <m>r_1 a + m_1</m> and <m>r_2 a + m_2</m> are two elements in <m>I</m>, then
            <me>
              (r_1 a + m_1) - ( r_2 a + m_2) = (r_1 - r_2)a + (m_1 - m_2)
            </me>
            is in <m>I</m>.
            Also, for any <m>r \in R</m> it is true that <m>rI \subset I</m>;
            hence, <m>I</m> is closed under multiplication and satisfies the necessary conditions to be an ideal.
            Therefore, by <xref ref="rings-prop-subring"/> and the definition of an ideal,
            <m>I</m> is an ideal properly containing <m>M</m>.
            Since <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal, <m>I=R</m>;
            consequently,
            by the definition of <m>I</m> there must be an <m>m</m> in <m>M</m> and an element <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>1=ab+m</m>.
            Therefore,
            <me>
              1 + M = ab + M = ba + M = (a+M)(b+M)
            </me>.

          <p>
            Conversely, suppose that <m>M</m> is an ideal and <m>R/M</m> is a field.
            Since <m>R/M</m> is a field, it must contain at least two elements:
            <m>0 + M = M</m> and <m>1 + M</m>.
            Hence, <m>M</m> is a proper ideal of <m>R</m>.
            Let <m>I</m> be any ideal properly containing <m>M</m>.
            We need to show that <m>I = R</m>.
            Choose <m>a</m> in <m>I</m> but not in <m>M</m>.
            Since <m>a+ M</m> is a nonzero element in a field,
            there exists an element <m>b +M</m> in <m>R/M</m> such that <m>(a+M)(b+M) = ab + M = 1+M</m>.
            Consequently, there exists an element <m>m \in M</m> such that
            <m>ab + m = 1</m> and <m>1</m> is in <m>I</m>.
            Therefore, <m>r1 =r \in I</m> for all <m>r \in R</m>.
            Consequently, <m>I = R</m>.

            First let us assume that <m>P</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m> and <m>R/P</m> is an integral domain.
            Suppose that <m>ab \in P</m>.

            then either <m>a + P = P</m> or <m>b + P = P</m>.
            This means that either <m>a</m> is in <m>P</m> or <m>b</m> is in <m>P</m>,

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p>
        Amalie Emmy Noether,<idx><h>Noether, A. Emmy</h></idx>
        one of the outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century,
        was born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882.
        She was the daughter of Max Noether<idx><h>Noether, Max</h></idx>
        (1844<ndash/>1921), a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen.
        Together with Paul Gordon (1837<ndash/>1912), Emmy Noether's father strongly influenced her early education.
        She entered the University of Erlangen at the age of 18.
        Although women had been admitted to universities in England, France,
        and Italy for decades,
        there was great resistance to their presence at universities in Germany.
        Noether was one of only two women among the university's 986 students.
        After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907,
        she continued to do research at Erlangen,
        occasionally lecturing when her father was ill.
      </p>

      <p>
        Noether went to Göttingen to study in 1916.
        David Hilbert<idx><h>Hilbert, David</h></idx>
        and Felix Klein<idx><h>Klein, Felix</h></idx>
        tried unsuccessfully to secure her an appointment at Göttingen.
        Some of the faculty objected to women lecturers, saying,
        <q>What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are expected to learn at the feet of a woman?</q> Hilbert,
        annoyed at the question, responded,
        <q>Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of a candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent.
        After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse.</q>
        At the end of World War I, attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women.
        After Noether passed her habilitation examination in 1919,
        she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her lectures.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at Göttingen.
        Over the next 11 years she used axiomatic methods to develop an abstract theory of rings and ideals.
        Though she was not good at lecturing, Noether was an inspiring teacher.
        One of her many students was B. L. van der Waerden,
        author of the first text treating abstract algebra from a modern point of view.
        Some of the other mathematicians Noether influenced or closely worked with were Alexandroff, Artin, Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin,
        von Neumann,
        and Weyl.
        One of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932.
        In spite of all the recognition she received from her colleagues, Noether's abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her lifetime.
        She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian academic bureaucracy.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1933, Noether, who was Jewish,
        was banned from participation in all academic activities in Germany.
        She emigrated to the United States,
        took a position at Bryn Mawr College,
        and became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
        Noether died suddenly on April 14, 1935.
        After her death she was eulogized by such notable scientists as Albert Einstein.

    <title>An Application to Software Design</title>
    <p>
      The Chinese Remainder Theorem is a result from elementary number theory about the solution of systems of simultaneous congruences.
      The Chinese mathematician Sun-tsï wrote about the theorem in the first century A.D. This theorem has some interesting consequences in the design of software for parallel processors.
    </p>

    <lemma xml:id="rings-lemma-chinese-remainder">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> be positive integers such that <m>\gcd( m, n) = 1</m>.
          Then for <m>a, b \in {\mathbb Z}</m> the system
          <md>
            <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a \pmod{m}</mrow>
            <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  b \pmod{n}</mrow>
          </md>
          has a solution.
          If <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are two solutions of the system,
          then  <m>x_1 \equiv x_2 \pmod{mn}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          The equation <m>x \equiv a \pmod{m}</m> has a solution since <m>a + km</m> satisfies the equation for all <m>k \in {\mathbb Z}</m>.
          We must show that there exists an integer <m>k_1</m> such that
          <me>
            a + k_1 m \equiv b \pmod{n}
          </me>.
          This is equivalent to showing that
          <me>
            k_1 m \equiv (b-a) \pmod{n}
          </me>
          has a solution for <m>k_1</m>.
          Since <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are relatively prime,
          there exist integers <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> such that <m>ms + nt = 1</m>.
          Consequently,
          <me>
            (b-a) ms = (b-a) -(b-a) nt
          </me>,
          or
          <me>
            [(b-a)s]m \equiv (b-a) \pmod{n}
          </me>.
          Now let <m>k_1 = (b-a)s</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To show that any two solutions are congruent modulo <m>mn</m>,
          let <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> be two solutions of  the system.
          That is,
          <md>
            <mrow>c_i &amp; \equiv  a \pmod{m}</mrow>
            <mrow>c_i &amp; \equiv  b \pmod{n}</mrow>
          </md>
          for <m>i = 1, 2</m>.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>c_2 &amp; \equiv  c_1 \pmod{m}</mrow>
            <mrow>c_2 &amp; \equiv  c_1 \pmod{n}</mrow>
          </md>.
          Therefore, both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> divide <m>c_1 - c_2</m>.
          Consequently, <m>c_2 \equiv c_1 \pmod{mn}</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          We will use mathematical induction on the number of equations in the system.
          If there are <m>k= 2</m> equations,
          then the theorem is true by  <xref ref="rings-lemma-chinese-remainder"/>.
          Now suppose that the result is true for a system of <m>k</m> equations or less and that we wish to find a solution of

          </md>.
          Considering the first <m>k</m> equations,
          there exists a solution that is unique modulo <m>n_1 \cdots n_k</m>,
          say <m>a</m>.
          Since <m>n_1 \cdots n_k</m> and <m>n_{k+1}</m> are relatively prime,
          the system
          <md>
            <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a \pmod{n_1 \cdots n_k }</mrow>
            <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  a_{k+1} \pmod{n_{k+1}}</mrow>
          </md>
          has a solution that is unique modulo <m>n_1 \ldots n_{k+1}</m> by the lemma.

        From <xref ref="rings-example-solve-system"/> we know that <m>19</m> is a solution of the first two congruences and any other solution of the system is congruent to <m>19 \pmod{20}</m>.
        Hence, we can reduce the system to a system of three congruences:
        <md>
          <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  19 \pmod{20}</mrow>
          <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  1 \pmod{9}</mrow>

        Solving the next two equations,

          <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  5 \pmod{7}</mrow>

        Solving this last system,
        we find that <m>19</m> is a solution for the system that is unique up to modulo <m>1260</m>.

    </example>

    <p>
      One interesting application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the design of computer software is that the theorem allows us to break up a calculation involving large integers into several less formidable calculations.
      A computer will handle integer calculations only up to a certain size due to the size of its processor chip,
      which is usually a 32 or 64-bit processor chip.
      For example,
      the largest integer available on a computer with a 64-bit processor chip is
      <me>
        2^{63} - 1 = 9{,}223{,}372{,}036{,}854{,}775{,}807
      </me>.
      Larger processors such as 128 or 256-bit have been proposed or are under development.
      There is even talk of a 512-bit processor chip.
      The largest integer that such a chip could store with be <m>2^{511} - 1</m>,
      which would be a 154 digit number.
      However, we would need to deal with much larger numbers to break sophisticated encryption schemes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Special software is required for calculations involving larger integers which cannot be added directly by the machine.
      By using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we can break down large integer additions and multiplications into calculations that the computer can handle directly.
      This is especially useful on parallel processing computers which have the ability to run several programs concurrently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most computers have a single central processing unit (CPU) containing one processor chip and can only add two numbers at a time.
      To add a list of ten numbers,
      the CPU must do nine additions in sequence.
      However, a parallel processing computer has more than one CPU. A computer with 10 CPUs, for example,
      can perform 10 different additions at the same time.
      If we can take a large integer and break it down into parts,
      sending each part to a different CPU, then by performing several additions or multiplications simultaneously on those parts,
      we can work with an integer that the computer would not be able to handle as a whole.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="rings-example-2134x1531">
      <p>
        Suppose that we wish to multiply <m>2134</m> by <m>1531</m>.
        We will use the integers <m>95</m>, <m>97</m>,
        <m>98</m>, and <m>99</m> because they are relatively prime.
        We can break down each integer into four parts:
        <md>
          <mrow>2134 &amp; \equiv  44 \pmod{95}</mrow>
          <mrow>2134 &amp; \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow>
          <mrow>2134 &amp; \equiv  76 \pmod{98}</mrow>
          <mrow>2134 &amp; \equiv  55 \pmod{99}</mrow>
        </md>
        and
        <md>
          <mrow>1531 &amp; \equiv  11 \pmod{95}</mrow>
          <mrow>1531 &amp; \equiv  76 \pmod{97}</mrow>
          <mrow>1531 &amp; \equiv  61 \pmod{98}</mrow>
          <mrow>1531 &amp; \equiv  46 \pmod{99}</mrow>
        </md>.
        Multiplying the corresponding equations, we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  44 \cdot 11  \equiv  9 \pmod{95}</mrow>
          <mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  0  \cdot 76  \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow>
          <mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  76 \cdot 61  \equiv  30 \pmod{98}</mrow>
          <mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  55 \cdot 46  \equiv 55 \pmod{99}</mrow>
        </md>.
        Each of these four computations can be sent to a different processor if our computer has several CPUs.
        By the above calculation,
        we know that <m>2134 \cdot 1531</m> is a solution of the system
        <md>
          <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  9 \pmod{95}</mrow>
          <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow>
          <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  30 \pmod{98}</mrow>
          <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  55 \pmod{99}</mrow>
        </md>.
        The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that solutions are unique up to modulo <m>95 \cdot 97 \cdot 98 \cdot 99 = 89{,}403{,}930</m>.
        Solving this system of congruences for <m>x</m> tells us that <m>2134 \cdot 1531 = 3{,}267{,}154</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversion of the computation into the four subcomputations will take some computing time.
        In addition,
        solving the system of congruences can also take considerable time.
        However, if we have many computations to be performed on a particular set of numbers,
        it makes sense to transform the problem as we have done above and to perform the necessary calculations simultaneously.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Rings are very important in your study of abstract algebra,
        and similarly,
        they are very important in the design and use of Sage.
        There is a lot of material in this chapter,
        and there are many corresponding commands in Sage.

    <subsection>
      <title>Creating Rings</title>
      <p>
        Here is a list of various rings,
        domains and fields you can construct simply.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
            <c>Integers()</c>, <c>ZZ</c>:
              the integral domain of positive and negative integers,
              <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            <c>Integers(n)</c>: the integers mod <m>n</m>, <m>{\mathbb Z_n}</m>.
              A field when <m>n</m> is prime,
              but just a ring for composite <m>n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            <c>QQ</c>: the field of rational numbers, <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            <c>RR</c>, <c>CC</c>:
              the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers,
              <m>{\mathbb R}</m>, <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
              It is impossible to create <em>every</em>
              real number inside a computer,
              so technically these sets do not behave as fields,
              but only give a good imitiation of the real thing.
              We say they are <term>inexact</term>
              rings to make this point.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            <c>QuadraticField(n)</c>:
              the field formed by combining the rationals with a solution to the polynomial equation <m>x^2-n=0</m>.
              The notation in the text is <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt{n}]</m>.
              A functional equivalent can be made with the syntax <c>QQ[sqrt(n)]</c>.
              Note that <c>n</c> can be negative.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            <c>CyclotomicField(n)</c>:
              the field formed by combining the rationals with the solutions to the polynomial equation <m>x^n-1=0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            <c>QQbar</c>:
              the field formed by combining the rationals with the solutions to <em>every</em>
              polynomial equation with integer coefficients.
              This is known as a the field of algebraic numbers,
              denoted as <m>\overline{{\mathbb Q}}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            <c>FiniteField(p)</c>: for a prime <m>p</m>,
              the field of integers <m>{\mathbb Z_p}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        If you print a description of some of the above rings,
        you will sometimes see a new symbol introduced.
        Consider the following example:
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        F = QuadraticField(7)
        F
        </input>
                <output>
        Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 7
        with a = 2.645751311...?
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        root = F.gen(0)
        root^2
        </input>
                <output>
        7
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        root
        </input>
                <output>
        a
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        (2*root)^3
        </input>
                <output>
        56*a
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        Here <c>Number Field</c> describes an object generally formed by combining the rationals with another number
        (here <m>\sqrt{7}</m>). <q>a</q>
        is a new symbol which behaves as a root of the polynomial <m>x^2-7</m>.
        We do not say which root, <m>\sqrt{7}</m> or <m>-\sqrt{7}</m>,
        and as we understand the theory better we will see that this does not really matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can obtain this root as a generator of the number field,
        and then manipulate it.
        First squaring <c>root</c> yields 7.
        Notice that <c>root</c> prints as <c>a</c>.
        Notice, too,
        that computations with <c>root</c> behave as if it was
        <em>either</em> root of <m>x^2-7</m>,
        and results print using <c>a</c>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This can get a bit confusing,
        inputing computations with <c>root</c> and getting output in terms of <c>a</c>.
        Fortunately, there is a better way.
        Consider the following example:
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        F.&lt;b&gt; = QuadraticField(7)
        F
        </input>
                <output>
        Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 7
        with b = 2.645751311...?
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        b^2
        </input>
                <output>
        7
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        (2*b)^3
        </input>
                <output>
        56*b
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        With the syntax <c>F.&lt;b&gt;</c> we can create the field <c>F</c> along with specifying a generator <c>b</c> using a name of our choosing.
        Then computations can use <c>b</c> in both input and output as a root of <m>x^2-7</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are three new rings that are best created using this new syntax.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
            <c>F.&lt;a&gt; = FiniteField(p^n)</c>: We will later have a theorem that tells us that finite fields only exist with orders equal to to a power of a prime.
              When the power is larger than 1, then we need a generator,
              here given as <c>a</c>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            <c>P.&lt;x&gt;=R[]</c>:
              the ring of all polynomials in the variable <c>x</c>,
              with coefficients from the ring <c>R</c>.
              Notice that <c>R</c> can be <em>any</em> ring,
              so this is a very general construction that uses one ring to form another.
              See an example below.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            <c>Q.&lt;r,s,t&gt; = QuaternionAlgebra(n, m)</c>:
              the rationals combined with indeterminates <c>r</c>,
            <c>s</c> and <c>t</c> such that <m>r^2=n</m>,
              <m>s^2=m</m> and <m>t = rs = -sr</m>.
              This is a generalization of the quaternions described in this chapter,
              though over the rationals rather than the reals, so it is an exact ring.
              Notice that this is one of the few noncommutative rings in Sage.
              The <q>usual</q> quaternions would be constructed with <c>Q.&lt;I,J,K&gt; = QuaternionAlgebra(-1, -1)</c>.
              (Notice that using <c>I</c> here is not a good choice,
              because it will then clobber the symbol <c>I</c> used for complex numbers.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Syntax specifying names for generators can be used for many of the above rings as well,
        such as demonstrated above for quadratic fields and below for cyclotomic fields.
      </p>

            <sage doctest="random">
                <input>
        C.&lt;t&gt; = CyclotomicField(8)
        C.random_element()
        </input>
                <output>
        -2/11*t^2 + t - 1
        </output>
            </sage>
    </subsection>

        The examples below demonstrate how to query certain properties of rings.
        If you are playing along,
        be sure to execute the first compute cell to define the various rings involved in the examples.

        For example,
        <c>Q</c> and <c>S</c> are extensions of the rationals,

        Not every element of a ring may have a multiplicative inverse,
        in other words,
        not every element has to be a unit
        (unless the ring is a field).
        It would now be good practice to check if an element is a unit before you try computing its inverse.

      <title>Quotient Structure</title>
      <p>
        Ideals are the normal subgroups of rings and allow us to build <q>quotients</q>
        <mdash/> basically new rings defined on equivalence classes of elements of the original ring.
        Sage support for ideals is variable.
        When they can be created, there is not always a lot you can do with them.
        But they work well in certain very important cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        The integers, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>,
        have ideals that are just multiples of a single integer.
        We can create them with the <c>.ideal()</c> method or just by wrting a scalar multiple of <c>ZZ</c>.
        And then the quotient is isomorphic to a well-understood ring.
        (Notice that <c>I</c> is a bad name for an ideal if we want to work with complex numbers later.)
      </p>

            <sage>
                <input>
        I1 = ZZ.ideal(4)
        I2 = 4*ZZ
        I3 = (-4)*ZZ
        I1 == I2
        </input>
                <output>
        True
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        I2 == I3
        </input>
                <output>
        True
        </output>
            </sage>
            <sage>
                <input>
        Q = ZZ.quotient(I1); Q
        </input>

                <output>
        True
        </output>
            </sage>

      <p>
        We might normally be more careful about the last statement.
        The quotient is a set of equivalence classes, each infinite,
        and certainly not a single integer.
        But the quotient is <em>isomorphic</em> to <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m>,
        so Sage just makes this identification.

      <p>
        So from a quotient of an infinite ring and an ideal
        (which is also a ring),
        we create a field, which is finite.
        Understanding this construction will be an important theme in the next few chapters.
        To see how remarkable it is, consider what happens with just one little change.

        There are a few methods available which will give us properties of ideals.
        In particular,
        we can check for prime and maximal ideals in rings of polynomials.

      <title>Ring Homomorphisms</title>
      <p>
        When Sage is presented with <c>3 + 4/3</c>,
        how does it know that 3 is meant to be an integer?
        And then to add it to a rational,
        how does it know that we really want to view the computation as 3/1 + 4/3?
        This is really easy for you and me,
        but devilishly hard for a program,
        and you can imagine it getting ever more complicated with the many possible rings in Sage,
        subrings,
        matrices, etc.
        Part of the answer is that Sage uses ring homomorphisms to <q>translate</q>
        objects (numbers) between rings.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will give an example below,
        but not pursue the topic much further.
        For the curious,
        reading the Sage documentation and experimenting would be a good exercise.

      <p>
        So <c>phi</c> is a homomorphism (<q>morphism</q>) that converts integers
        (the domain is <c>ZZ</c>)
        into rationals
        (the codomain is <c>QQ</c>),
        whose parent is a set of homomorphisms that Sage calls a <q>homset.</q>
        Even though <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> both print as <c>3</c>,
        which is indistinguishable to our eyes,
        the parents of <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> are different.
        Yet the numerical value of the two objects has not changed.

          if it is an integral domain and if it is a field.
