	<title>Homomorphisms</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>One of the basic ideas of algebra is the concept of a homomorphism, a natural generalization of an isomorphism. If we relax the requirement that an isomorphism of groups be bijective, we have a homomorphism.</p>

		<p>Two groups are related in the strongest possible way if they are isomorphic; however, a weaker relationship may exist between two groups.  For example, the symmetric group <m>S_n</m> and the group <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> are related by the fact that <m>S_n</m> can be divided into even and odd permutations that exhibit a group structure like that <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>, as shown in the following multiplication table.</p>

			<p>Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>g \in G</m>. Define a map <m>\phi : {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow G</m> by <m>\phi( n ) = g^n</m>. Then <m>\phi</m> is a group homomorphism, since

				<p>(3) The set <m>\phi(H_1)</m> is nonempty since the identity of <m>G_2</m> is in <m>\phi(H_1)</m>. Suppose that <m>H_1</m> is a subgroup of <m>G_1</m> and let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be in <m>\phi(H_1)</m>. There exist elements <m>a, b \in H_1</m> such that <m>\phi(a) = x</m> and <m>\phi(b)=y</m>.

				<p>(4) Let <m>H_2</m> be a subgroup of <m>G_2</m> and define <m>H_1</m> to be <m>\phi^{-1}(H_2)</m>; that is, <m>H_1</m> is the set of all <m>g \in G_1</m> such that <m>\phi(g) \in H_2</m>.  The identity is in <m>H_1</m> since <m>\phi(e) = e'</m>. If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are in <m>H_1</m>, then <m>\phi(ab^{-1}) = \phi(a)[ \phi(b) ]^{-1}</m> is in <m>H_2</m> since <m>H_2</m> is a subgroup of <m>G_2</m>.  Therefore, <m>ab^{-1} \in H_1</m> and <m>H_1</m> is a subgroup of <m>G_1</m>. If <m>H_2</m> is normal in <m>G_2</m>, we must show that <m>g^{-1} h g \in H_1</m> for <m>h \in H_1</m> and <m>g \in G_1</m>. But

		<example xml:id="example-homomorph-g2-to-r">
			<p>Let us examine the homomorphism <m>\phi : GL_2( {\mathbb R }) \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^\ast</m> defined by <m>A \mapsto \det( A )</m>.

The image of a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Z}_7</m> must be a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>. Hence, there is no injective homomorphism; otherwise, <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m> would have a subgroup of order 7, which is impossible. Consequently, the only possible homomorphism from <m>{\mathbb Z}_7</m> to  <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m> is the one mapping all elements to zero.</p>

		<title>The Isomorphism Theorems</title>
 
		<p>Although it is not evident at first, factor groups correspond exactly to homomorphic images, and we can use factor groups to study homomorphisms. We already know that with every group homomorphism <m>\phi: G \rightarrow H</m> we can associate a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, <m>\ker \phi</m>.  The converse is also true; that is, every normal subgroup of a group <m>G</m> gives rise to homomorphism of groups.</p>
 
		<p>Let <m>H</m> be a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>. Define the <term>natural</term><index><main>Homomorphism</main><sub>natural</sub></index> or <term>canonical homomorphism</term><index><main>Homomorphism</main><sub>canonical</sub></index>  
			<me>\phi : G \rightarrow G/H</me>
		by
			<me>\phi(g) = gH.</me>
		This is indeed a homomorphism, since
			<me>\phi( g_1 g_2 ) = g_1 g_2 H =  g_1 H g_2 H = \phi( g_1) \phi( g_2 ).</me>
		The kernel of this homomorphism is <m>H</m>. The following theorems describe the relationships between group homomorphisms, normal subgroups, and factor groups.</p>

			<statement>
				<p>If <m>\psi : G \rightarrow H</m> is a group homomorphism with <m>K =\ker \psi</m>, then <m>K</m> is normal in <m>G</m>. Let <m>\phi: G \rightarrow G/K</m> be the canonical homomorphism.  Then there exists a unique isomorphism <m>\eta: G/K \rightarrow \psi(G)</m> such that <m>\psi =  \eta \phi</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<proof>
				<p>We already know that <m>K</m> is normal in <m>G</m>. Define <m>\eta: G/K \rightarrow \psi(G)</m> by <m>\eta(gK) = \psi(g)</m>.  We first show that <m>\eta</m> is a well-defined map.  If <m>g_1 K =g_2 K</m>, then for some <m>k \in K</m>, <m>g_1 k=g_2</m>; consequently, 
					<me>\eta(g_1 K) = \psi(g_1) = \psi(g_1) \psi(k) = \psi(g_1k) = \psi(g_2) = \eta(g_2 K).</me>
				Thus, <m>\eta</m> does not depend on the choice of coset representatives and the map <m>\eta: G/K \rightarrow \psi(G)</m> is uniquely defined since <m>\psi =  \eta \phi</m>. We must also show that <m>\eta</m> is a homomorphism, but

						<mrow>&amp; = \psi(g_1) \psi(g_2)</mrow>
						<mrow>&amp; = \eta( g_1K) \eta( g_2K ).</mrow>
					</md>
				Clearly, <m>\eta</m> is onto <m>\psi( G)</m>. To show that <m>\eta</m> is one-to-one, suppose that <m>\eta(g_1 K) = \eta(g_2 K)</m>. Then <m>\psi(g_1) = \psi(g_2)</m>. This implies that <m>\psi( g_1^{-1} g_2 ) = e</m>, or <m>g_1^{-1} g_2</m> is in the kernel of <m>\psi</m>;  hence, <m>g_1^{-1} g_2K = K</m>; that is, <m>g_1K =g_2K</m>.  </p>

			<proof>
				<p>We will first show that <m>HN = \{ hn : h \in H, n \in N \}</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.  Suppose that  <m>h_1 n_1, h_2 n_2 \in HN</m>. Since <m>N</m> is normal, <m>(h_2)^{-1} n_1 h_2 \in N</m>. So

				<p>Now define a map <m>\phi</m> from <m>H</m> to <m> HN / N</m> by <m>h \mapsto h N</m>. The map <m>\phi</m> is onto, since any coset <m>h n N = h N</m> is the image of <m>h</m> in <m>H</m>. We also know that <m>\phi</m> is a homomorphism because

				<p>Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>N</m>. Since <m>N</m> is normal in <m>H</m>, <m>H/N</m> makes sense.  Let <m>aN</m> and <m>bN</m> be elements of <m>H/N</m>. Then <m>(aN)( b^{-1} N )= ab^{-1}N \in H/N</m>; hence, <m>H/N</m> is a subgroup of<m>G/N</m>.</p>
