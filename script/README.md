# Makefile for Project Management

Read instructions in the `Makefile` which explains that `Makefile.original` needs to be copied to `Makefile.paths` before this is useful.

In particular,  DO NOT EDIT

* `Makefile`
* `Makefile.original`
* `Makefile.example`

as their changes are managed by revision control and *will* be overwritten.
